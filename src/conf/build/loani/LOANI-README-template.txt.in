	LOANI : Lazy OSDL's Automatic Net Installer



This is LOANI version ST_LOANI_VERSION, released on ST_LOANI_DATE.


LOANI's purpose is to automatically retrieve, extract, build and install every OSDL's prerequesite and OSDL itself, so that having one's OSDL developer installation working is as easy as just entering :

./loani.sh

or, preferably if you want to be sure to have a sane build environment :

./loani.sh --buildTools

These two commands result in the installation, among other helper libraries, of Ceylan and OSDL. These two libraries can be retrieved in various versions (current archive release/current stable/cutting edge), thanks to various means (archive or SVN).


End-users may preferably run the following command as a normal (non-root) user :

./loani.sh --buildTools

They will get and use latest stable archive release for Ceylan and OSDL, with all necessary tools (ex : compiler toolchain) automatically installed under their own user account (the system tree will not be affected, no root permissions needed).

OSDL developers may use the following command to retrieve the version of Ceylan and OSDL currently in SVN :

./loani.sh --allTools --sourceforge <your SourceForge user name>

They will install as well all tools, including for example those needed to generate documentation. 


For a better understanding of LOANI's use, one can :
	- enter on his terminal : ./loani.sh --help
	- refer to the LOANI-dedicated page from our main site : @LOANI_WEB_HOMEPAGE@
	

In the case you encounter error(s) despite careful reading of the documentation, please send the file coming from our generator of bug reports (just run it thanks to ./generateBugReport.sh from the directory where you extracted LOANI's archive) to our mail account dedicated to troubleshooting, @LOANI_MAILING_LIST@.
		
We will do our best to investigate and overcome the issue.
		
	
Thanks a lot, and have fun using OSDL !
