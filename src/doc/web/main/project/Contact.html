  <h1>Contact, support, feedback for OSDL's community</h1>

  <p>Different means are available in order to give and take more informations about everything related to OSDL :</p>

  <ul>
  
    <a name="ml"></a>
    <li>OSDL's &quot;every topic&quot; mailing list is <a href="mailto:ragondinsforever@yahoogroups.com">ragondinsforever@yahoogroups.com</a>.
    You have to <a href="mailto:ragondinsforever-subscribe@yahoogroups.com?subject=subscribe" target="_blank">subscribe</a> first (just send a mail from a valid address and specify <code>subscribe</code> as subject).<br>
    Please, do not hesitate to send a mail to that list ! [<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ragondinsforever/" target="_blank">list main page</a>]</li>


	<a name="bugFound"></a>
	<li>you have found a <b>bug</b> in LOANI, Ceylan or OSDL ? If you are using LOANI, we advise you to use the <code>generateBugReport.sh</code> script at the root of your extracted LOANI archive. The most reliable alternate way of letting us know is to send a detailed mail to <a href="mailto:osdl-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net?subject=Bug%20report">osdl-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net</a> (no registering to list required). Please specify in this case : 
	<ul>
		<li>the <b>platform</b> and <b>tools</b> you were using (ex : <code>Gentoo 1.4 on an Athlon 2800+ with a Radeon 9200 (128 Mb), using gcc 3.2.2 and SDL 1.2.7</code>)</li>
		<li>the <b>full versions</b> (major-minor-release or even tag) of our project modules (ex : <code>Ceylan-0.2.1 tag STABLE_20040227</code>)</li>
		<li>what you <b>did</b> to obtain the abnormal behaviour</li>
		<li>the exact <b>error messages</b> you got</li>
	</ul>Thanks a lot !</li>
	
    <li>trackers, task managers, and so on, are to be found through <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/osdl/" target="_blank">OSDL's SourceForge interface</a>. We preferred using another <a href="http://www.murlock.org/forum/" target="_blank">forum system</a>, since the Sourceforge's one does not seem that good to us</li>

    <li>we form a small community around a club for game programming. It is called <b>Circle of the Floodlit Coypus</b> (the litteral translation of the french <b>Club des Ragondins Illuminés</b>) and is available in real life (weekly meetings) and on IRC [<a href="../club/ClubMenu.html" target="toolbar">more info about the club</a>] (in french only)</li>

	<li>an IRC channel, which can be found in <a href="irc://eu.undernet.org" target="_blank">eu.undernet.org</a>, on the channel named <code>#osdl-club</code></a>. As we seldom are on IRC, one should preferably use our <a href="#ml">mailing list</a> to suggest an appointment before</li>
	
    <li>you can also send a mail to <a href="mailto:olivier.boudeville@online.fr?subject=[OSDL]">the
    main OSDL author</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>All those means of communication are free for read/write operations, for OSDL's members and for others (except the forum which require an easy registration before one being able to post). 
  </p>
  
  <p>Please note that, for the moment, there is, in some way, a kind of mix between the means of communication for our library, OSDL, and for the community that uses it, i.e. mainly our club for game creation, the famous <em>Circle of the Floodlit Coypus</em>. At the moment, both community are gathered in one [<a href="../club/Club.html">More infos</a>]</p>

  <p>In a few words, everyone is welcome to express himself about OSDL, so please do not hesitate and <a href="mailto:olivier.boudeville@online.fr?subject=[OSDL]%20Hello%20!">tell us</a> what you want !</p>


	<h2>Historically</h2>
	<p>
	We changed a couple of times of mailing-list system :
	<ol>
		<li>We began with <a href="mailto:osdl-club@lists.sourceforge.net">osdl-club@lists.sourceforge.net</a>, which was convenient but suffered too frequently of random delays (up to 48 hours to have a mail delivered !). We therefore moved, but made so that every other list has been subscribed to this one, therefore its <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=35205" target="_blank">archive</a> contains all of our messages</li>
		<li>After, we used <a href="mailto:cri@ml.free.fr">cri@ml.free.fr</a>, which did not provide archive, and seemed to loose some mails, and duplicated others. So we moved again</li>
		<li>We currently use <a href="mailto:ragondinsforever@yahoogroups.com">ragondinsforever@yahoogroups.com</a></li>
	</ol>
