  <h1>Why don't you join OSDL ?</h1>
  

  <p>OSDL is a young project, yet ambitious. The project is fully open to everyone's contribution, whichever it may be (if you cannot figure out what you can do, <a href="mailto:olivier.boudeville@online.fr?subject=[OSDL]%20How%20can%20I%20help%20?">we can suggest you ideas</a>, depending on what you are interested in). The most sought after community is maybe developers, as long as OSDL's core remains quite small. Actually, OSDL tries to focus on coding, even if it is only one of the necessary ingredients of a game. The reason for it is that one can find other projects, altough less numerous, which focuses on other parts of video game, namely content (such as pictures, animations, models, sounds, rules, stories, etc.). One of these is <a href="http://www.worldforge.org/" target="_blank">WorldForge</a>, an amazing project which we like very much (they provide developments too). To get an overview of these projects, go to our <a href="../resources/ResourceMenu.html" target="toolbar">resources section</a>.</p>

  <p>In a few words, everyone is welcome, so please do not hesitate and <a href="mailto:olivier.boudeville@online.fr?subject=[OSDL]%20Hello%20!">tell us</a> about what may interest you !</p>
