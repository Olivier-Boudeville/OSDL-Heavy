  <h1>Why don't you join OSDL ?</h1>
  

  <p>OSDL is a slow-moving project, yet ambitious. It is fully open to everyone's contribution, whichever it may be. If you cannot figure out what you can do, <a href="mailto:olivier.boudeville@online.fr?subject=[OSDL]%20How%20can%20I%20help%20?">we can suggest you ideas</a>, depending on what you are interested in.
  </p>

  <p>  
 The most sought after community is maybe developers, as coding requires quite an heavy workload. Actually OSDL tries to focus mainly on development, even if it is only one of the necessary ingredients of a game. The reason for it is that one can find other projects, altough less numerous, which focus on the other parts of video game elements, namely content (such as pictures, animations, models, sounds, rules, stories, etc.). To get an overview of these projects, go to our <a href="../resources/ResourceMenu.html" target="toolbar">resources section</a>.
