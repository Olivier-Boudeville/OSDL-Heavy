<h2>Ponctual contribution</h2>

  <p>If one is the author of new and original content of any kind, or if one would like to join our effort, here are some of the numerous ways to contribute to OSDL :</p>

  <ul>
    <li>one could <a href="mailto:olivier.boudeville@online.fr?subject=[OSDL]%20Code%20Contribution">
    submit</a> new modules, ports, patches, extensions, bug corrections and so on for the OSDL's family (OSDL, Ceylan, and so on)</li>

    <li>there are many things that can be done for the website, the documentation, the translation effort, and so on, so non technical persons should not worry. We can, too, help you learning whatever technical knowledge we already know, in order you to contribute technically, even if you are rather unsure about your capacities : there is no overwhelming complicated stuff, in what we do, that could not be explained. If you do not know C++, we however encourage you to start learning this language as soon as possible if you think it will be relevant for what you want to do (we can advise you) :it is not really a short term process indeed ! <br>[see our <a href="../../resources/Technical.html">technical resources</a> section].</li>

    <li>we welcome any kind of  <em>artistic</em> content (pictures, models, musics, artwork, rules, scenarios and so on), which be as well submitted to <a href="http://www.worldforge.org" target="_blank">WorldForge</a> or other content websites to ensure a maximal distribution [see our <a href="../../resources/ResourceMenu.html" target="toolbar">resource section</a>]. Your artwork may therefore make its way in our own content repository [<a href="mailto:olivier.boudeville@online.fr?subject=[OSDL]%20Artistic%20Contribution">submit</a>].</li>

    <li>you can also <a href=
    "mailto:olivier.boudeville@online.fr?subject=[OSDL]%20I%20do%20not%20really%20know%20which%20way%20I%20can%20contribute"> send a mail to us</a> in order we help you determining what you could do. In that case, please do your best to explain what you have already done before knowing OSDL, what you are able to do, and what you would like to do. We are sure of two points : 

      <ol>
        <li>you should not be scared nor shy, cause we are all nice people, and everybody is able to find something he can do in the OSDL project</li>

        <li>we can find something which interests both of us !</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>last but not least, you are kindly invited to join our little <strong>game creation club</strong>. This club is intended to gather some
      people interested in game creation (not only technical game development), and focuses on our first game which could be described, in a few words, as a Dungeon-Master-like roleplaying game. The club is open to everyone, even to remote members (purely on the Internet). 
      <ul>
        <li><a href="../../club/ClubMenu.html" target=
        "toolbar">All details about the club</a> [mainly in french only for the moment]</li>

        <li><a href="../../club/game/GameMenu.html" target="toolbar">All details about the game</a> [mainly in french only for the moment]</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <p>We also consider that using OSDL (as a tool) for your project (a multimedia application or a game, for example), whatever it may be,
  is some kind of contribution, and we will do our best to bring you support and advices so that you achieve what you intended.</p>

  <h2>What about becoming a member of OSDL project ?</h2>

  <h3>Why would I become an OSDL's member ?</h3>

  <p>If one wishes to contribute regularly to OSDL, it will soon be necessary to be identified as an OSDL member in order to be given
  relevant permissions on the project's system (access with write permission for CVS, website, mailing list, trackers or other tools).</p>



  <h3>How can I become an OSDL's member ?</h3>

  <p>You have to subscribe to <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/osdl-general" target="_blank">OSDL's general mailing list</a>, and to make yourself know of others members by contributing a bit, your own way, to the project (a kind of short probation period !).</p>

  <p>Then, send us a <a href="mailto:olivier.boudeville@online.fr?subject=[OSDL]%20I%20want%20to%20become%20a%20project%20member%20!">
  request of membership</a> or ask us directly, and you will receive an answer from us within a few days (keep in mind we form an open community around OSDL, based on good will, so do not worry too much !). You should then register yourself as a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/account/register.php" target="_blank">SourceForge user</a> (of course it is free), and we will grant you the permissions you need.</p>

  <p>This description might seem probably excessively formal, but be confident is the fact that we are running a small, simple and nice project, so do not feel anxious, and contact us. Besides, the OSDL project and the OSDL-club are somewhat intricated and overlap themselves, so whatever are your goals in the field of game creation, you should find something of interest either in the project or in the club, if not in both.</p>
  <br>

  <p>In a few words, every contribution is welcome in OSDL, so please do not hesitate and <a href="mailto:olivier.boudeville@online.fr?subject=[OSDL]%20Contribution%20!"> tell us about what you plan to do</a> as soon as possible.</p><br>
