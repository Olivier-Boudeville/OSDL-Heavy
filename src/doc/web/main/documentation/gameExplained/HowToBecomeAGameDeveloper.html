IGDA Posts Open Letter On Game Industry Quality Of Life

The issue of 'quality of life' for game developers has been once again thrust into the spotlight, following a recently reported weblog entry from an Electronic Arts employee's spouse, and legal action regarding excessive uncompensated working hours from separate EA employees.

In relation to this, the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) has posted a new open letter on the issue, titled "Quality of Life Issues are Holding Back the Game Industry." The letter, signed by the entire IGDA Board of Directors, argues that the situation at hand is a vicious cycle, in part a result of fundamental changes within the industry.

In particular, the evolution of technology, one-sided contracting and possible lack of project management expertise are singled out as contributing to the quality of life issue. But the letter also notes that developers may also be a part of the problem, in part due to submitting themselves to extreme working conditions, as well as the need to prove themselves to their peers, commenting: "Our own attitudes towards work/life balance and production practices need to change just as much as the attitudes of the 'suits.'"

The IGDA letter then goes on to accentuate the positive, citing companies such as BioWare, Firaxis, Team17, Blue Fang, Cyberlore and Ensemble as examples that have proven that a focus on quality of life can lead to great titles.

It also dissuades those calling for unionization of game developers via the IGDA, explaining that the organization cannot become a union, nor is it a union. This is due to the fact that it's a non-profit professional association, one with a different role - also, being an international organization, union forming would be outside of its organizational scope.

However, the IGDA goes on to state that it will be holding a 'best companies to work for' initiative, one in which the association will provide awareness of the more enlightened companies and their practices within the industry. This will be followed up with a full-day qualify of life think-tank event at the Game Developers Conference [part of the CMP Game Group, as is Gamasutra] during March 2005.

A Creative Commons-licensed LiveJournal weblog post from someone describing themselves as 'ea_spouse' has raised a number of questions regarding continuing 'quality of life' problems within the game development industry. In the post, which specifically targets giant publisher Electronic Arts, the anonymous writer documents what she considers an unacceptably escalating work schedule for her partner on a currently in-production EA game, explaining:

"Within weeks production had accelerated into a 'mild' crunch: eight hours six days a week... When the next news came it was not about a reprieve; it was another acceleration: twelve hours six days a week, 9am to 10pm... The current mandatory hours are 9am to 10pm -- seven days a week."

'ea_spouse' goes on to argue that this 'calculated' crunch isn't necessarily a last-ditch effort:

"This crunch also differs from crunch time in a smaller studio in that it was not an emergency effort to save a project from failure. Every step of the way, the project remained on schedule. Crunching neither accelerated this nor slowed it down; its effect on the actual product was not measurable."

Although it's unclear whether these allegations are in any way true or universal, the 'quality of life' issue continues to be a major discussion point within game development.

In particular, an International Game Developers Association Quality Of Life survey recently found that game developer spouses are extremely likely to respond that "You work too much..." (61.5% of those surveyed) or that "You are always stressed out." (43.5%), and that 34.3% of developers expect to leave the industry within 5 years, and 51.2% within 10 years. Jason Della Rocca of the IGDA commented at the time of the survey: "While game development is a stimulating and rewarding career, the work conditions are often taxing, making it hard to sustain a balanced lifestyle and leading many senior developers to leave the industry before they've done their best work."



I had an interview with Flying Lab software a couple of days ago.  I 
didn't pass what should have been an extremely easy interview covering 
basic C++ such as inheritence, virtual functions, 1st year student stuff.

Here's a semi-accurate transcript of the last few minutes that sums it 
all up:

Interviewer: "How would you store enemies in an RTS?"
Me: "I generally store game objects in a dynamic array of pointers. 
However, sometimes you might want to also store the pointers in a tree 
for searches"
Interviewer (Paraphrase): If the enemies were being used to render you 
would store them in a rendering tree.
Interviewer: Is there any case where you wouldn't want to store objects 
as pointers but store them directly?
Me: "I can't think of anything.  There was one case in my last game." <I 
pointed out a case where you would store a unique value in a tree for 
fast searches>.
Him: "You would store an object directly that if the object took less 
memory than the pointer.  You aren't experienced enough so we don't need 
to continue this interview." <Click>

Basically, my failure was in not being able to read the guys' mind.  It 
might mean I wouldn't want to work for such a person, but there was no 
reason for me to not pass the interview.

The lesson I learned from this and that I would like to share is it's 
important to be more assertive than I was with loaded questions.  Don't 
even try to guess because you are sure to fail.  The correct answer 
would have been, "There is no answer to that question because it is too 
vague"



Then I was in San Diego, I noticed
several companies will ask questions based entirely on his articles,
especially 'The Guerilla Guide to Interviewing'
http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000073.html.
I've actually seen and had interviews that were detailed in this article
almost verbatim.



I've been through dozens of interviews that ended like that. The person
doing the interviewing has one pet answer and anyone who gives them a
different answer is going to fail the interview. Very little you can do
about it. 

I was in an interview just last Tuesday that went pretty much that way.
I made the mistake of saying that the product looked like it was
affected by second system syndrome. And then had to explain what that
meant. Which means that the lead developer had 0 training in software
engineering. The interview went down hill from there.

This kind of stuff happens so often... it is a wonder that any software
gets written at all.




From time to time, I apply to game studios
here in europe but most of the time they are
interested in programmers that already have
released some titles or have some GREAT demos to show.

That's the answer... release a game. 

As the demand for games programmers is about the same as the number of
experienced game programmers, game companies will be taking risks
employing a "wannabee", especially when experienced developers are
available. I too am a wanabee.

So the answer to get into the industry is to have released a game. I'm
gambling that it doesn't have to be a game in a box in a computer game
shop, but can also be published on the net. My plan is to produce a
game, and publish it solely for the purpose of breaking into this
market.

As I see it this is the least you (or I) will need to do.

And if you get the job with the big game company be prepared for the
fact that you will now just be one cog in the game development machine.
You will no longer be in charge of every part of game development. You
won't know why the decisions were made the way they were. You will not
be consulted on things you are used to being in charge of. And, you will
have to live with the organization as it exists.

What I am trying to say is that the transition form being an independent
game developer to working for a company as a game programmer can be
traumatic. It can be a very painful experience. Going from being the
only fish in the pond to being a minnow in an ocean is hard to deal
with. Be prepared for some hard knocks on your ego. Be prepared for the
competition you will face.

I have seen people come completely unglued when their preconceptions of
what is was like to be a game programmer came in contact with the
reality of the job.

And with some (quite successful) game houses (no names) you will probably 
find that you are overworked and underpaid and under-training.  Not wanting 
to put prospective developers down but it's a tough business!

You forgot to mention that, in any kind of software development, after a=20
certain age no company will hire you no matter how good you are. Like spo=
rts,=20
it's a short-lived career.

I probably left that out because I am currently living that situation. I
was laid off from my last full time job (R&D on doing
games/entertainment on cell phones) on my 49th birthday in 2001. I
haven't been able to get an interview for a full time technical job 
since then. I was able to get contract software testing work off and on
for the next year, but nothing since this time last year. 

All I can say is that I was very lucky to be able to keep doing
technical work through my 40s. Most people don't make it through their
30s. 

I was also very lucky that I learned in my 20s that you have to save
between 10 and 20 percent of your gross income if you expect to survive.
All programmer go through dry spells. Technical jobs pretty much dry up
every 10 years of so. I've seen in happen in the early '70s,  the early
'80s, the early '90s, and the early '00s. 

Programming is a tough profession.

You can establish your own small company (just a few people) and to sign 
a contract with game publishing company. When you finish your game they 
will sell it and will pay you a percentage. This is good way to start.


Jeff Vogel (http://www.spiderwebsoftware.com) :
 Releasing
a shareware game is a great way to get a job in this business.  It's a sort of
walking resume/portfolio.
If you want to show people you can write a computer game and learn how to
write
a computer game, the only real way to do it is to write one.  It's a lot of
work, but this craft is worth it.

If you aren't Sony or Origin or Sierra, it's EXTREMELY difficult to get your product onto shelves.

Is Spiderweb Software your full-time job at the moment?
Spiderweb Sof:  Ewww. I just noticed that Friends is on.
Spiderweb Sof:  Ewww.
Spiderweb Sof:  Yep, Spiderweb has been my full-time job since 1995.
Spiderweb Sof:  Now, it's two people's full-time job.
Spiderweb Sof:  The recent games have been far too difficult and time-consuming to do on a part-time basis.
Spiderweb Sof:  It's very difficult to actually finish a shareware rpg. It's very easy to get it 9/10 done, and then all of a sudden get stuck.
Spiderweb Sof:  I fully sympathize with Glenn Andreas, for example, and the Delver project.
Spiderweb Sof:  It's really easy to go a long way down the road and then hit this really difficult barrier and take forever to get past it.
Spiderweb Sof:  Being full-time and having no choice but to finish the game is how I deal with this.
Spiderweb Sof:  A lot of promising games hit that barrier, sink, and are never heard from again.


Game programming can be great fun and a great job if you find a good
company.  Unfortunately, all but one of the companies that I have worked for
treat programmers as... well programmers.  The upper management didn't share
the fun parts of making the game and didn't seriously consider any other
group's input.  This is probably how you will wind up, and in my opinion it
doesn't make sense to work for such a company.  Why assume the risk, low
pay, long hours, and pressure of working for a game company without the fun
part?

Even if you find a good company, many jobs are being outsourced to the
lowest bidder, such as India, Russia, etc.  It's much harder to find a job
than even a three years ago and what is left is less desirable.

Bob :

What will drive up the demand for US programmers? 

What happens is that a huge number of people who are currently
programmers will stop programming. Over time it will get harder and
harder to hire people to do the jobs that you just can't more out of the
country, then the demand will start to build.  But, it will never be as
high as was in the late '90s. Expect salaries closer to 30K than to 90K.

The same thing happened to mechanical engineers in the early '70s and
the late '80s early '90s. When the US stopped going to the moon a huge
number of engineers were put out on the streets. Most never got jobs as
engineers again. When the Soviet Union feel apart, again, a huge number
of engineers were laid off and many never worked as engineers again.
Now, you can get a job as an engineer. Those jobs aren't as numerous as
they were and they pay much less than they used to. But, you can get a
job.


The contracts that most techies work under in the US grant ownership of everything they write to their employer even if they do it on their own time on their own equipment. Of course, that depends on the state you live in and some times even which federal court district you live in. I, personally, do not have legal ownership of 95% of the code I wrote on my own time on my own machines.
