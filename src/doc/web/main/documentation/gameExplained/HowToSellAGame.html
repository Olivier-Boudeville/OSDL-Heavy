The Internet has grown so much and encompasses so many different groups of people that there's literally a market for anything.  MUDs, MOOs,

Of course if you want to sell games you have to go to the lowest common 
denominator machines. Even the best commercial games claim to run on P3 
boxes with 64MB of RAM (lol). So getting all steamed up about 
multi-threading is probably a bit premature. The vast majority of the market 
(PC anyway) are still sitting with machines they bought years ago.

As for pricing, since you will be in an international business, I would
suggest using a somewhat cheaper and perhaps more widely used currency
such as the Japanese Yen or the US dollar. With the current exchange
rate 9.99 GBP is nearly twenty USD and might be a bit steep for US
customers, considering that it is between 1/3 and 1/2 of the price of a
major A level game. OTOH, a price of 9.99 USD or 999 JPY would be seen
as very accessible in most of the industrialized world. 

Simply based on the total size of the potential markets you might want
to list prices in Yen, US dollars, and Euros. Those currencies cover
markets that reach about a billion people. And that is not counting the
regions of the Americas that are used to doing business in USD.

BTW, you might want to look at the games listing on libsdl.org. There
are a lot of potentially commercial games listed there.


Would selling to Japan and Korea require localization of game VO's and text or leaving everything in English be acceptable enough?


It seems that in a large part of the world, and especiallyin Eastern Europe and South America, the people looked down on localized games. They assumed that they were done by local people and must be inferior to commercial games produces in the US and the UK. But, I don't think there were any comments from anyone in Japan or China.

I think that so much of the world learns English as a trade language that English is accepted for games in a lot of places that don't speak English as a native language. OTOH, I have heard a lot of complaints about the use of American English versus British English. Large parts of the world were once part of the British Empire and are very particular about speaking "The Queens English" and look down on American English.

Personally, I would not try to do localization unless you have access to an expert on the culture you are targeting. 


The best way to sell a game as an ameteur game coder looking to become pro
that i can see is by making a website posting your games with screenshots
and demo versions.  Take payments through paypal, let them download the full
version upon payment, and try to link to and get linked from as many gamer
type pages as possible.

And dont forget, good games are about whats fun, not about spectacular
graphics


if I make some game what is the easiest way to sell it?


Depends on the game. If it is an "A" title or the PC, peddle it to the
big studios. If it is a typical garage game, then go to a site that
specializes in selling such games. Or, you can go the shareware route
and get the game on every DL site you can find so people will see it and
hopefully pay you for it. If it is a cell phone game, then try to get it
listed on the cell phone DL sites. If it is for a PDA, then try to get
it listed on the well trafficked PDA game sites... 

The things that sell your game are:

o How well advertised it is
o How good the game is





>I'm interested are here some authors of commercial games (using SDL 
>> of course).


Gabriel here. My tiny company : http://www.mysterystudio.com


>> What prices those games have? 


$19.95(US), pretty standard price point for downloadable games.



>> In how many copies are they sold? How much profit they achieve per

week?

Sorry, can't comment on that. If you're really interested, go to
http://forums.indiegamer.com where a bunch of independent game
developers gather regularly. My advice : read, read, read, read a lot
before asking "how much money do you make" on your first post. There's a
TON of knowledge in the current posts and in the former Dexterity
forum's archive (link at the bottom of the page)



>> How is sale organized - on some web site or ...? 


Many of us sell from our websites and partner's websites (affiliates and
publishers). Other lucky guys have retail deals, arcade deals, and some
have its games bundled with every new Mac sold!



>> Are there people that actually make living of it?


Yes, some people are.



>> Can I see some of those game (demos) in action? 


Most of us use a shareware business model, which means you have free
access to the game demos.




Best is an up front fee followed by a percentage of the gross. 50-50 is
probably fair. No matter what, do not accept a percentage of the net.
There is no net, ever. 

BTW, "gross" means total amount paid before any costs. "Net" means the
gross minus all the costs. Since taxes are usually paid based on the net
profit a good business never makes a profit. Much better to pay higher
salaries or acquire new products. There is never any net.

>> for a few thousand.  


Exactly, you don't want to track his sales. But, you must have the legal
right to audit his books and other records to verify that he is telling
your the truth about his sales.


>> Should I get a lawyer to do a whole contract thing?


Yes, absolutely. Get a lawyer and get a contract. You pick the lawyer.
Try to bill him for the cost. Do not let him pick the lawyer. Do not let
him pay the lawyer directly. The lawyer must work for you. Do not allow
the other guy to control the document. 


When it comes to business I trust people to comply with the letter of
the contract. Nah... not really, I trust them to do what will get them
the whole pie no matter what the contract says.

BTW, one test of the fellows honesty is how willingly he goes along with
all this.



(1) Contract terms. Either a portion of sales or flat fee can work, you
pays your $ and u takes your chances. If the other guy is a poor startup
and so are u, royalty is likely fairest, coz he can't afford to pay u in
advance what it'll be worth if it takes off - or mebby anything at all.
50-50 seems high for a network API, unless i'm mistaken it's not half the
work. If it's 10% of the work of writing a game engine, u might start at
10% royalty, but be prepared to go as low as 3% in that case, coz building
a thing is likely about 1/3 of the cost of succeeding with it. I assume the
other guy (Ok, he's "Joe") will do, or arrange at his expense, all the
marketing, promoting, distributor sourcing etc., and he's gonna have to
sell 40-80% of his game's income to get that done.

Look at it this way - 5% of a warm fizzle isn't much different than 50% of
a warm fizzle, but 5% of a rocket to the moon will let u retire, and u
ain't gonna get 50% of that trip, unless u happen to have a distributer and
a cuppla vulture capitalists to bring to the table. 

If u want him to put a few $ up front as good faith, then u might make it a
"non-refuindable advance on royalties". Say your cut comes out to $1/unit
sold, and he pays an advance of $2,000, then he pays no further royalty on
the first 2000 sales. U hafta protect yourself, but u hafta see how scary
it looks to the other guy too.

When negotiating the contract terms, tie your share firmly to whatever Joe
is gonna benefit from, that way u can count on his natural greed to improve
things for u too. E.g. take a small percent of his gross sales (which he
wants to maximize) rather than a larger % of his "profits", which is an
accounting term for "zero". And same for "shares" in his (privately held)
company - they, and "profits", are worth whatever his accountant says
they're worth. If your royalties are tied to whatever it is that Joe gets
out of it, then it's a win-win.

And pay attention to the ownership of your API. In exchange for royalty
obligations, Joe gets something like a "non-exclusive, non-expiring,
non-transferable" right to use your API. He doesn't own it, and while he
can sell it in his game to a customer or wholesaler, he doesn't get to sell
its use in his product to MicroSoft for $3.5 mil in 5 years when they buy
him out. Or, he does - u don't want to queer that sale - but then u get a
piece of the buyout, and veto rights if the terms are different from the
present ones. 

(2) Getting legal help writing a contract amounts to a risk-management
issue. If you're legal-anal like i am, u might calculate the "expectation
value" of the deal, along these lines: odds of your partner getting into
big $ with your product's help, times the odds he'll screw u if he does,
times the odds a contract would help u even if u had one, times whatever u
think "big $" might be. 

Repeat the calculation again, assuming no contract. The difference between
the two scenarios' expectation value is your best guess at the value of a
contract. If it exceeds your legal budget, give it a whirl.

IOW there's no point spending $2000 in legals to protect an idea with a
maximum potential sale of $10,000 and 20% success odds, coz u just break
even. Same for a potential of $1,000,000 and 0.2% success odds. 'Course if
you're gonna be doing this more than once, possibly a boilerplate contract
would be an investment.

To keep legal costs down, don't go to a lawyer with a problem, go to him
with a solution u want implemented. Lawyers love solving problems. I.e.
don't sit down in a plush office and start with "i have this API and i
think i want to protect it somehow". Start with "Me and Joe have this very
specific idea for how we could jointly exploit my software, here's the
details we'd like u to put in contract form". 

And make sure "Joe" is already on-side with all the terms and conditions u
want, /before/ your lawyer turns on his meter. Even better, have Joe's
lawyer draw it up (at Joe's expense) first, then have your lawyer look at
it. U don't want Joe changing his mind while u pay a lawyer to write it up
twice. Writing up a fair, even-handed written agreement into a fair,
even-handed legal contract might cost $2,000. If your lawyer starts
negotiating terms with the other side's lawyer, it will get to $10,000
faster than u can say "Lawyers love lunch". Tell your lawyer what your
budget is, and (s)he should tell u what it will cost, and should justify
any over-runs _in_advance_.

About picking a lawyer - get a contract / commercial law specialist. If he
also handles divorce and real estate, he likely doesn't know enough about
IP (Intellectual Property) law, but will be pleased to do research for u at
$200/hr. Sometimes u can get a good deal with a small law firm with mebby 6
guys, one specializing in contract / commercial / IP. 

One other thing - have a calendar-time limit as well as a billable-time
limit. If your lawyer fails to return your phone calls or respond to your
needs in a timely fashion, can his a$$ and move on. Which is why u will
pick a lawyer who doesn't ask for a big up-front retainer. $1000 retainer
on a $2000 job should be just fine, u top it up when he's used up half the
budgeted time (and explained what he's done with it). IMX, lawyers who want
big up-front retainers are the ones who overbook and leave u hanging out to
dry. The big retainer is so u can't walk away at that point. 


I'm familiar with Qualcomm's BREW setup.  It's an API
(libraries for doing junk like drawing, playing MIDI and MP3, setting
timers, and doing menus and input; much like SDL or, I imagine, Qt/GTK+/etc.)

It's also a distribution channel.  It goes like this:

  1. Company produces game
  2. Qualcomm tests & (hopefully) approves
  3. Wireless providers (like Verizon) (hopefully) accept game
  4. Consumers on that carrier notice the game in their "Get It Now!" menu
     and (hopefully) decide to purchase
  5. Game is downloaded over the air
  6. User is billed automatically in their next statement (or something)


Now, if one were to use an LGPL'd library (like SDL) within the app,
since the only way to _produce_ the app is by statically linking [*],
one would need to provide the "object" version, in case the users
("consumers" in steps 4 and 6, above) want to upgrade their library.

But, uh... how do they upgrade?  How do they relink?  They won't have
the proprietary tools needed to build/link the app in the first place,
let alone any MEANS to getting the app ONTO the phone!  :^(

Sucks, but that's how it works, some times.
