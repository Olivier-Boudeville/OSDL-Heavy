iDevGames & OMG :

iDevGames announced a new contest on October 18th aimed at Indie devs, which programmers of SDL should make note of. In a nutshell, iDevGames teamed up with Freeverse Software, a noted publisher of Mac/Win original titles on this contest. We normally run "uDevGames", a much bigger game development contest at this time of the year, however, with uDevGames moved to a new summer schedule, iDevGames decided to start the "OMG Cup" contest. There's been a good number of SDL-based games entered in iDevGames' various contests through the years. Non-Mac developers can join in the fun with the right tools -- a savvy Windows/Linux developer can produce a Mac binary for entry into the competition. With uDevGames, iDevGames has given away over $70,000 in prizes to past developers, with many of them going on to professional work in the industry -- OMG Cup is on a smaller scale, but we feel that interest will be just as great. If you want to enter or have any questions on the OMG Cup, head on over to Official Contest page at:
