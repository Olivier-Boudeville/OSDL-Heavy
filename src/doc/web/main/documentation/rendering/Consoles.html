I quite enjoy DirectX. PS2 coding... I loathe.
I heard that the XBox uses DirectX for its graphics system. I wouldn't mind 
getting my hands on the SDK.
Alas, Microsoft is being a dick and not allowing independent developers to 
get the dev kit... hell, they won't even allow colleges to have them. My 
teacher was on the phone with the head of the XBox division, and after 6 
months, the guy finally told him no, and that he should try phoning Bill 
"Mr. Money" Gates. What bums. They really don't see how that could possibly 
benefit them, do they? I guess not.
But, I've also heard that the Gamecube SDK is the best SDK over all of the 
other dev kits, and Nintendo provides amazing support. I wouldn't mind 
trying that SDK either.

The XBOX environment is a little unusual in that it runs on an i386 CPU  
with the executables being very similar to normal Win32 apps, except that  
they *must* be statically compiled (ie. no DLLs are available - save for a  
few kernel calls).  There is no notion of "drivers" as Windows/Linux knows  
them; each XBOX game/program is basically compiled into one monolithic  
application... so I can't program to a driver interface.

The APU on the XBOX is a NVIDIA nForce.

nforce audio is a (almost fully compliant) ac97 chip. So documentation 
for any ac97 chip could be used. For example intel's (which AFAIK is the 
only ac97 doc around) :
