Tiles :

Path-finding is easier/faster/cleaner with tiles.

It takes more effort to make non-tiled maps look good.

Tiled maps require less disk space and therefore download faster and don't
require disk swapping.

Tiled maps are not limited in size to 10x10 screens.  You may not have to
divide the world into separate maps at all if you use tiling.

Tiled maps load faster.
