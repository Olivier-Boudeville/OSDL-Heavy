ball-movement :

I think you need to turn to aerodynamics for that one - and you need
to simulate ball spin too, if you aren't already.

Some links explaining the phenomenon:

Or if it's Curve Ball
(http://www.fetchfido.co.uk/games/curve_ball/curve_ball.htm) you're
trying to implement, a Newton-style constant acceleration applied each
frame is enough =)
