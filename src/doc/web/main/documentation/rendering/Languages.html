Java :


LWJGL is better to use if you just want to write games.  I recall that it has texture loading stuff already built-in, and it has sound libraries attached, and all sorts of great things for games built into it.

The problem is that it's very watered down.  (Lightweight, as they call it).  I wanted the option of multithreading, and adding a lot more, and being overall more Java-friendly.  That's something that I recall LWJGL not being, is very Java-like.  (And I think there was something about the sound code on OS X at the time, maybe).  So I searched around more and found JOGL.

JOGL is more of a "Lets you use OpenGL in Java" library.  Not designed for games at all, specifically.  So it's more like writing an OGL program from scratch than from a games library.  Also a smidge more bothersome is that you have to have a GL (and GLU) context which gets passed around, and that's how ALL the drawing calls for the GL context get done -- writing "GL.glBegin()" etc...  That prefix is annoying, and with the LWJGL you CAN circumvent that if you use Java 1.5, through the static imports.  In JOGL, this is impossible.

LWJGL they kept a very linear, not objective feel to the API. JOGL is not as games-dev-based, but they managed to turn JOGL into a nicely object-oriented-friendly API for graphics programming.

Both use Java binding libraries, which is... interesting to install and use, though certainly not hard. 

If you want to create games, you'll probably want LWJGL.

Talking of profiling, can anyone recommend a good free profiler for 
Java?  I've used the -Xrunhprof option, but needless to say its not the 
most user-friendly thing in the world!

http://www.appperfect.com/ : the full version is only free for 15 days (which was enough to really help me out a lot), after which the license reverts to a "Personal" edition (ie. less features). 
The full version is just under $500 US
