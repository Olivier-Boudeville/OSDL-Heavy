animation is my primary interest (I want to do animation for film) so I'll give it a shot. My 
favorite, and top, program is Maya by far, but of course if you are going 
for games Maya is the film standard and 3ds Max is the games standard. There 
are parts of 3ds Max I have never liked though, and I've always loved the 
way Maya is set up. There is a personal learning edition of Maya which just 
watermarks your renders which you can try out if you like, and 
learning-maya.com has over a thousand tutorials. Maya's documentation also 
includes a full set of tutorials to get you started which comes free with 
the learning edition. An educational edition of Maya (the full program but 
with an educational license costs $285 for complete and $385 for unlimited). 
Animation Master is another great program. It is the program that got me 
started on animation before I moved to Maya. It is a spline modeller, but 
there is a $20 plug-in that lets you export to .x format, and it can do 
everything (textures, animation, modelling). Not only that but it does them 
very well in an extremely intuitive interface especially for a beginner. You 
can take a look at www.hash.com, and it costs $300 retail. Caligari also has 
a program they launched about a year ago called Gamespace. It is basically 
Truespace without some of the facial animation and particle features, and 
also a few extra features added for games. There is a free version of 
Gamespace which you can try, and some good video tutorials at 
www.3dbuzz.com. Also concerning Max there are tutorials on 3dbuzz, and in 
numerous other places. You can get the trial version of Max, or even use 
Gmax if you want to try it out. Max is about $300 with an educational 
license, if not you know how much it is. Also of note is Softimage's newer 
program XSI which was used for Half Life 2 and the movie Sin City. I have 
yet to use it so I can't say much about it, but it is supposed to be really 
good. There is a trial version of that also. 

You could try Anim8or(free and support animation). You could try gmax, but 
to use it commercially and to unlock a few stuff you have to pay I think. 
Milkshape 3D is $20. 3D canvas is a good 3d modeller as well but I dont 
think it supports animation.


Loading : 

I managed to adapt a 3ds loader in a couple of days and have it working.
But if you want keyframe animation you have to buy gametutorials CD. I
havent found any full 3ds loader. 
But if you are going to use milkshape, better try to load ms3d files, i
think the format is better documented, and supports skeletal animation.
Another good format is .X

I've seen some demos that use the MilkShape3D format, and seem to pull it 
off rather nicely.
Personally, at school, my team used LightWave for creating our models, then 
I wrote a custom exporter that creates a format I can use. Of course, this 
didn't have ANY animations and such. If you're using animations, you might 
want to look at the simpler model formats to get yourself started. I don't 
think 3DS Max files would be all that easy, and I can definitely tell you 
that LightWave is NOT simple either. It can be a pain in the butt to learn, 
especially since there aren't that many resources online, so you'd end up 
pouring over incomplete documentation.

The .X files are well structured, and don't take long to learn. And, if you 
decide to use DirectX as your graphics API, it's made all the more easier 
with the Mesh and SkinnedMesh classes. If you're in need of any reference 
material, I'd suggest "Focus on 3D Models". I've found that to be quite 
helpful for me. As well, the book covers quite a few model formats, and how 
to load and animate them. It also comes with a CD full of source code and 
demos.


* Load  3d models from file :

	- I've tried 3ds, using '3ds File Loader' tutorial from http://www.gametutorials.com/Tutorials/opengl/OpenGL_Pg4.htm, 
and it works brilliant (but crashes when try to load more models)

The easiest format to load 3D models would be to use ASE - it's a text based format and easy to pull those details from - its also a common format.  For a list of file formats try www.wotsit.org. Other formats that might be worth looking at are .3DS and .X

http://myfileformats.com/

You might like to also try OBJ format, it can be exported from blender and a lot of other packages.  Has texture mapping support and is totally text based.  It's also very simple.

i want to import *.3ds file to my OpenGL scene
www.xbdev.net : You can easily adapt the code to your needs.

You could buy the book "Focus on 3D Models", which has a section on loading
3ds files, among many other file formats and a nice section on quaternions.

GameTutorials.com has a couple tutorials on loading and using animations
from 3ds files, but those tutorials aren't free anymore. Kinda sucks, but
worth the $5.

There is also http://lib3ds.sourceforge.net/ which may be a fair starting
point for reading in 3ds files.

http://www.spacesimulator.net/tutorials.html

for 3ds-files there is lib3ds at sourceforge.net The source includes a sample viewer using OpenGL. For animated models I use cal3d (can be found on sf.net too). I think NeHe has a tutorial on using MS3D files, so it shouldn't be that hard. If you need something with lots of features, go with Collada. They have several OpenGL viewers to show the usage.
