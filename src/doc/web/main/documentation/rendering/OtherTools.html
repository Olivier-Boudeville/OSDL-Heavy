Python + C++

SWIG does not had extra dependency : it actually generates a 'stand-alone' C/C++ source code file that 
wraps your C/C++ functions and classes.  The wrapper provides an 
interface to your code from Python.  All you need to do is add this 
C/C++ file to your project.  Once you have generated the wrapper code 
you do not need to have SWIG installed, so your code will compile on 
another machine with just the python development stuff  installed.

An advantage of SWIG over Boost is that at any time you can change your 
scripting language without modifying your C/C++ source code (well, 
unless you have some functions that deal directly with python).  All you 
have to do (in theory) is specify a different scripting language target 
on the SWIG command line.  Also, to compile Boost code on another 
machine you need to have Boost installed.

Does anyone know of a (free) tool that will make a font into a set of equally sized tiles?
