<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This section focuses on the different ways of managing graphics thanks to SDL and his helper libraries.
</p>

  
<h2>Video</h2>
  
<h3>DVD</h3>

<p> 
All video DVDs use MPEG-2 video. DVD movies are generally 720x480 (for NTSC), sometimes interlaced, sometimes progressive (recommended). Note though that the pixels are generally not square, so you will either have to generate your output accordingly (recommended), or resize it after.
</p>

<p>The image aspect ratio can be 4x3 or 16x9, and the pixels will just be stretched to a rectangular shape in one direction or another. </p>

<h3>Overlays</h3>

<code><pre>
Does SDL support me in getting the resolution?
SDL_GetVideoInfo()->current_w and ->current_h 


During my main event check loop, SDL_PollEvent (&event) gets no events as I am resizing.  One SDL_VIDEORESIZE event only comes after I stop resizing the window. That's the intended behavior. It works that way on Windows too, whereas on X11 there are continuous SDL_VIDEORESIZE events while resizing.

I remember there being some kind of option I could switch on when I played with compositing (not XGL, just X.org) under KDE that fixed this problem when using SDL-based apps.


Set the XLIB_SKIP_RGBA_VISUALS environment variable.  This works in all
WMs, not just KDE.

        export XLIB_SKIP_RGBA_VISUALS=1

Any programs launched with this var set won't get access to modes with an
alpha channel.  You won't be able to set the opacity of windows without an
alpha channel, though.  If you want to be able to do that in the normal
case, you could set up a script you can launch stuff that doesn't like
alpha through:

<center>
    <table summary="Code" style="border : none">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="box">
<code><pre>
#!/bin/sh
XLIB_SKIP_RGBA_VISUALS=1 "$@"
</pre></code>
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</center>
I have a big image that is 8 meg of ram. It is more than 65536 bytes wide, whereas SDL only uses 16 bit integers to store all pixel offsets and such. This will not work.

SDL is compiled with --enable-video-fbcon.
Frame buffer is running (/dev/fb exists, permissions ok, /proc/fb has device name - I tried Savage FB and also Vesa FB
Btw. mplayer is running (-vo fbdev and fbdev2 also) 
Try running as root.  The usual problem is permissions on the mouse and
keyboard devices.
I've tried to set SDL_VIDEODRIVER=fbcon or fbdev -> nothing changes
I'm trying it with test/testvidinfo - which works under X for me. 


SDL supports hardware accelerated blitting of ``normal'' surfaces to the
screen surface. However, this mode is not supported for X11 (except for
some cards when using DGA). In fact, the only backend hardware accelerated
memory-to-screen blitting is well supported seems to be the DirectX5 backend
for Windows.

You should look at the glscale backend :
http://icps.u-strasbg.fr/~marchesin/sdl/sdl_glscale.patch

If the OpenGL implementation supports DMA for texture uploads (which 
almost all drivers do) it will accelerate upload of screen portions, and 
try to avoid format conversions when possible. Plus as a nice bonus, you 
get free bilinear scaling.

It is a cross-platform SDL based video capture lib. I've had success with it
in OS X and Windows, but I can't vouch for its Linux talents.


There isn't a cross-platform way to get webcam data. You'll need to use
the v4l2 API on Linux. Mac, Linux, and Windows all have ways to get this info,
just no unified way, except for portVideo

Why force a specific pixel depth?  Why not use SDL_ANYFORMAT and convert your surfaces to the appropriate format?  Even in the same pixel depth SDL might have to do something like convert between orderings.


If you're doing complete fullscreen redraws, you might as well use SDL_DOUBLEBUF and SDL_Flip().  It won't confer any advantage in software mode but *hardware* doublebuffering really flies if you can get it -- 50% less data movement for every frame.


For a static overlay, just render it all into an RGBA texture of sufficient size. (Remember that some cards may not support 2048x2048 
or even 1024x1024 textures! You may have to do some tiling, or just hardwire your code for 256x256 tiles if that is easier.)

Overlays are done in hardware, therefore their behaviour cannot be changed.

Alpha channel blending is a full-out read-modify-write operation.  Unless you arrange some form of hardware acceleration, it's going to be slow.  Note 
that alpha=128 is a special case for which SDL is optimized.

Full-screen updating.  If you're going to be updating the *entire screen* 
every frame, why not use SDL_DOUBLEBUF and SDL_Flip?  That's what it's there 
for.

A surface can be either an SWSURFACE, HWSURFACE or OPENGL surface. 
 
SDL_HWACCEL is not a valid flag to SDL_SetVideoMode. That's not the use for it.

You cannot have a mouse cursor with hardware surfaces in fullscreen mode. Paint the mouse cursor yourself.


Blits should not become garbled by not calling SDL_DisplayFormat. SDL converts pixel formats as necessary; not calling SDL_DisplayFormat will decrease performance due to the conversion taking up CPU every time the blit is performed, but should not cause incorrect blits.

When using SDL_DOUBLEBUF, SDL_Flip() is the way to go, documentation does not say whatSDL_UpdateRect() does in case of double buffering.


Not only CRT monitors, but also LCDs (in notebooks and the ones connected to PCs) have vertical retrace -- they rely on the same kind of videosignal (even those with digital input -- only the signal uses pulse code modulation!)

Thus these LCDs behave very much like and ordinary CRT.

I beleive most displays use some serial (possibly not sequential) display update, since they have serial connection to display memory.

 SDL *does* wait for video sync on platforms that
support it. Because it can not be implemented on every platform and
configuration the buffer flipping API for SDL was designed so that you
get the benefits of video synchronization on platforms that support it
(and here is the genius part) *without* having to worry about it. The
API allows the developers of SDL to support triple buffering (and
N-buffering if it is useful) and gives you the benefit of those features
without making you worry about specifically waiting for vsync. 

By hiding the details of video synchronization behind the API SDL allows
the use of the best way to get smooth animation on each platform
including using video synchronization and N-buffering where appropriate
while allowing the SDL API to be implemented on the most primitive video
displays.

There is a lot of detail on this topic in the article at
http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2003/08/07/sdl_anim.html The
parts that cover this subject are on the second page. In the article I
do give some tricks for detecting the type of flipping being done by a
particular SDL driver.

I'd suggest JPG if you want destructive compression, and PNG for 
pretty much everything else, including <=256 color images. Most other 
formats will result in bigger files, and some aren't always supported 
if you rely on dynamic linking. (No GIF by default on some Linux 
distros, for example.

<h3>Creating a video from the output of an SDL application</h3>

<p>
Two main methods exists : 
<ul>
	<li>have the <b>application</b> directly record its outputs (each frame leads to a screenshot, and a special audio driver is used to store directly the raw sound to a file)</li>
	<li>use a <b>generic "grabber"</b> which acts as a different application</li>
</ul>

most of the problem with "dark edges" that are seeing is due to software alpha blending that is not clamping colors components to the range 0 to 255. The use of 1/256 means that you can get 256 as a result of alpha blending and that wraps to zero. Which gives you very dark colors.

  
Can I get info about pixels per inch on my screen?

No SDL API and even if there was, it wouldn't be reliable.

Applications that really care usually offer the user some way of overriding whatever the graphics subsystem says, as that option is often abused as a way of scaling fonts system wide. Of course, here's also a rather big risk of the monitor(s) being detected incorrectly, and the PPI values being off for that reason.What do you need it for? What kind of accuracy and reliability do you need? If it's really important, maybe it's easier, safer and/or better to just ask the user?

  
Can you try commenting out the (SDL_QuitSubSystem(SDL_INIT_VIDEO)
and the SDL_InitSubSystem(SDL_INIT_VIDEO)?

just do the SDL_SetVideoMode() to change to a new mode...

  
*Never* blit from the screen! You could end up 
reading VRAM, which is slow enough that just a few sprites will 
render slower than rerendering the whole screen every frame.

  
To simply create n colors as visually different as possible : work in the HSV color space, and take a number of points (equal to the number of colors) regularly spaced around H axis, and take S=1 and V=1. Then, I convert the color from HSV space to RGB space for each of these points.

The HSV color space is another way of representing colors. Instead of 
having red, green and blue components, you have hue, saturation and value.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSV_color_space

Similarly, you'll find the hsv to rgb conversion algorithm and code quite easily.


Remove SDL_HWACCEL flag from video flags : it is useless in SDL_SetVideoMode, and it is read-only on surfaces. It won't buy you any 
performance, it's not an undocumented l33t trick, it just spreads 
misconceptions about how SDL works.
Also, SDL_HWPALETTE and SDL_DOUBLEBUF are useless together with an 
OpenGL context.


Note that an SVGAlib program needs to be suid-root in order to run.
Also note that you can't launch an SVGAlib program from an xterm; you
need to run it from an linux console.

These facts actually make the use of the SDL_VIDEODRIVER env variable
redundant. You can just run the program directly, and SDL will use
whichever video output is available:

* If run inside of X, SDL will use the X driver.
* if run from a text console & suid-root, SDL will use the SVGAlib driver.
* If run from a text console & not suid-root, SDL will use the AAlib driver.

(Assuming of course you have an SDL library that supports all three drivers.)
while this was true with svgalib-1.4.x this is certainly not true with 
svgalib-1.9.x
that's what the svgalib_helper kernel module is for

if you just want to copy your surface, the action you're looking for 
matches the row "RGBA->RGBA without SDL_SRCALPHA", "The RGBA data is 
copied to the destination surface. If SDL_SRCCOLORKEY is set, only the 
pixels not matching the colorkey value are copied."

So, in your code, before blitting some_image to temp, disable SDL_SRCALPHA 
in some_image using SDL_SetAlpha:

SDL_SetAlpha(some_image,SDL_RLEACCEL,0);

No, we are emulating page-flipping behavior in this case, primarily for 
the benefit of retrace-synchronized updates. The screen surface is 
actually a software surface that updates to the screen in another 
thread and in sync with the monitor (60hz on LCDs w/ADC or DVI).



windowed modes always return SDL_SWSURFACEs.  SDL_VideoInfo
reports i have support for it and it works fine in fullscreen modes.

<h2>Alpha-blending</h2>

per-surface alpha and hardware surfaces?

The basic rule of thumb is... don't use alpha and 2D hardware surfaces.
With almost all of the current drivers, the alpha blending has to be done
in software, which means that each pixel needs to be read over the bus,
modified, and written back out over the bus.  This is the slowest operation
you can do. 

You'll get better results by either using OpenGL or by using software surfaces.
	

the reason SDL uses colorkey instead of a mask, is because a colorkey
can be hardware accelerated on more platforms, is built into several image
formats, and can be converted to a mask easily.



When blitting from an alpha surface to an alpha surface, SDL doesn't 
copy the alpha channel. What I eventually did was copy pygame's 
alphablit function (http://pygame.org/). Some say that there is a way to 
make SDL do the correct blits, but I've never managed that.  Also, the 
docs for SDL_SetAlpha() say:

"Note that RGBA->RGBA blits (with SDL_SRCALPHA set) keep the alpha of 
the destination surface. This means that you cannot compose two 
arbitrary RGBA surfaces this way and get the result you would expect 
from "overlaying" them; the destination alpha will work as a mask."

SDL does'nt handle alpha->alpha blits correctly, it's a known issue.  The
only option short of not trying to composite surfaces together that you have
is to write your own blitter than can handle this case.


Hardware surfaces are not available in windowed mode (except on Amiga 
IIRC). OTOH, they are available in fullscreen mode on Windows (via directx).
