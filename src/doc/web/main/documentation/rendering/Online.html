XBOX Live
1) Centralized service:  All the game servers go through microsoft, using 
MS's api for every game.
2) Broadband required.  Risky as a large amount of people still have dialup.
3) No EA.  (We're microsoft, we don't need EA)
4) Relatively large amount of online enabled console games out already.
5) We're getting subscribers faster than time warner, hbo... etc.  1 
million in 1.5 years.

Argument:  Because we're a centralized service, people will be more likely 
to pay for us because they get more value out of the larger amount of games 
that can be played on our service.  And because its centralized and uses 
our standard API, it has a consistent look and feel with a online community 
that is interchangeable and that spans multiple games (think of battle.net 
and the way you can message starcraft people from diablo).  And, even 
though broadband is less prevalent, it will allow for a better experience 
for those people who do have it.

SONY
1) We don't like Microsoft.  Neither should you.
2) Hey look, we made Everquest!  The best online game ever!
3) And look we made Everquest on the console!  And because Everquest PC was 
the best online game ever, it will be the best console online game ever.
         - by the way, you can actually buy a new mouse and keyboard and 
use it with our console, but you don't need a hard drives because our 
server technology is so good.
4) AND, we made an add on to Everquest console to make the console copy of 
the best even better!
5) Oh yeah, and we have Final Fantasy XI.  But it requires a hard drive, so 
it'll cost a bit more.
6) We did some market research and most people are not hardcore, some 
people are hard core... and very few (<1%) people are ULTRACORE.

Argument:  We don't like Microsoft.  And since we have the add-on to the 
copy of the best online multiplayer game EVER, we'll beat them, even if 
right now we only have 2 distinct titles and an add-on released.  Since its 
worked so well for us, we're retaining the PC per-game subscription model.


Ok, enough of that.

Quite simply it boils down to number of online games available, and price 
to play those games.  Sony has two titles.  Microsoft has a lot more than 
two ( http://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/live-gameslist.htm  (not all are 
online play, but still, more than two are) ).  And it doesn't look like MS 
is charging as much as I thought they would for it (50$/year.  who knows if 
it will last... but...)  Right now its cheaper to sign up for all of XBOX 
live than it is to play one game on Sony (6$/month vs 10$+)  Now XBOX isn't 
going to get everquest fans (I suspect everquest fans will stick to the pc 
rather than go to playstation), but i think XBOX live will have that kind 
of online "arcade" type feel, which I think is pretty cool actually.  And 
far superior to Sony or Nintendo has at the moment.  And by the time they 
decide to copy, it may be too late.


I'm inclined to agree on the online debate that XBox has the upper hand. 
Almost every game I have for the XBox has online capability to either play 
head-to-head or download new content.

I haven't much about the online capabilities of the Gamecube, so I can't 
comment on that.
I know how hard it is to program ANYTHING for the PS2, so it's not all that 
surprising that there aren't many online games for that console. The PS2 is 
such a hard system to code for... I spent 2-3 months working on the dev kit 
that Sony released to the public... There was waaaay too much stuff to learn 
just before you could draw a triangle. I have so much respect for the 
developers that work with that platform.
