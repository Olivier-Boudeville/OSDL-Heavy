<code><pre>

i write a game that has some settings and data in a loadable
library.

On Linux i create a shared object:
gcc -Wl,-Bdynamic -Wl,-shared -o skin skindata.o -lc

On Win32 i do it like this:
link /dll /nologo /subsystem:console /incremental:no \
    /machine:I386 /map:skin.map /out:skin.dll skindata.o

On Linux i have to load it like this:
skin = SDL_LoadObject("/absolute/path/to/skin");

On Win32 i load:
skin = SDL_LoadObject("skin.dll");

Until here, both work fine.

  sfptr = (skin_info_get_fptr)SDL_LoadFunction(skin, "skin_info_get");
  if(sfptr == NULL) {
    printf("could not get skin data address\n");
    exit(-1);
  }

On Linux the part above works fine, on Win32 it fails.  In the skin.map
i see that the symbol "_skin_info_get" is contained in the dll.
I also tried to load with preceding underscore, but that also failed.

Can anybody tell me why it fails on Win32?
You need to explicitly list the symbols that are exported in a Windows 
DLL (this is actually a feature, but it's different than the current 
Linux behaviour, if you don't count gcc's new -fvisibility command line).

You probably have:

extern SkinInfo *skin_info_get(void);

You need something more like this:

extern "C" {  // (If using C++, you need this or the symbol is mangled.)
     extern __declspec(dllexport) SkinInfo *skin_info_get(void);
}

This tells Windows that this symbol needs to be exported from the DLL. 
Otherwise it won't be visible at link time, or from LoadLibrary().

Look at DECLSPEC in the SDL headers for an example of abstracting this, 
since SDL on Windows obviously needs this functionality itself. gcc4 has 
a similar mechanism, but at this point, most Linux libraries have every 
symbol that isn't flagged "static" as exported, which is why this works 
there.

Is there a way on Linux to NOT use an absolute path?
Use a relative one.   :)    Using none goes through a couple of 
well-defined paths (see the manpage for dlopen(3) for the list).

Use ./skin for example.



  
I want to create 2 surfaces with sdl 
Invoke a child process to create the second SDL surface, then use pipes to 
communicate between processes.
Under win32, shared memory will be more efficient


>When I compile my app with gcc, it didn't find SDLMain.

That usually means that your source file in which you define the main() 
function does not #include SDL.h. You *must* #include SDL.h in that 
file, because it contains something like

   #define main SDLMain

Then, the real main() is provided by libSDLmain.
I didn't find a way to detect when user switches away from prog from the
docs, but maibye Ive overseen it. I need it to know when I have to reset
video mode in windowed Opengl Window.

The code I have is as follows:

       while (SDL_PollEvent(&event))
       {
          if(event.type == SDL_ACTIVEEVENT)
            {
                if(event.active.state==SDL_APPACTIVE || 
event.active.state==SDL_APPINPUTFOCUS)
                {
                    if(event.active.gain==0)
                    {
                        //do this when the user has clicked outside
                        //of the window, or when the window loses
                        //focus.  Works on Linux and Windows
                    }
                }
             }
          }
       }

You can probably make it nicer if you want, but this step by step look 
at it might help you do other things with window events.
<h2>Building SDL</h2>
  <p>
  
  SDL_VIDEO_WINDOW_POS=x,y
putenv("SDL_VIDEO_WINDOW_POS=10,10");

  Did you try the cross compiling instructions available there :
http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/cross/README.txt
I can get most programs to cross compile that way.
  
 Try removing the file config.cache, and re-run configure.  If you ran configure before installing jpeg/z/png, it caches the results of those library checks into the config.cache file so if you run configure again it goes faster.  (At least I think that's the reason, though it seems kinda silly to me .  You can tell this is happening by the fact that "(cached)" appears in the line "checking for...".  So just  remove that file, configure, compile/install, and hopefully it'll work! 
</p>
static link (only possible if you are (L)GPLed)


Never use Alpha together with HWSURFACE
Alpha is done by CPU and needs to READ from the videosurface. Video 
card memory access is optimized for writing but very slow for reading.



i load an image that has exactly the size of my SDL window.

I'd like to set this picture as the background picture and
draw some OpenGL in front of it.

What you want to do is set your screen to orthographic mode to draw the
background.

orthographic = 2d-ish so you can more easily draw a pciture to fill the
whole background of the screen.

http://www.gametutorials.com/Tutorials/OpenGL/OpenGL_Pg2.htm

go there and check out "masking and ortho mode" to figure out ortho mode

Make a huge quad that covers the entire window area and then apply your 
texture on it.
It is only a OpenGL issue, not a SDL one. Remember that your textures 
sides must be in power of 2 so OpenGL can render it.
That quad will have a Z value higher than the other objects in your 
scene so it appears to be in the background.



<h2>Installing SDL</h2>
  <p>

SDL_DOUBLEBUF implies SDL_HWSURFACE. You will *not* get a double 
buffered h/w display surface with a s/w shadow surface by saying 
SDL_DOUBLEBUF | SDL_SWSURFACE. (SDL_SWSURFACE == 0 BTW...)

However, SDL_FULLSCREEN is often required to get a h/w surface at all, 
and pretty much always required for a double buffered h/w surface. 
(Windowed modes generally do not support page flipping.)
  
Unless you completely cover the screen with new graphics 
every frame, you have to clear the screen one way or another. 
SDL_Flip() either copies your shadow buffer to the display surface, 
or swaps the visible page with the one you just rendered into. These 
cases are different, but they have one thing in common: Old stuff is 
left around until you draw over it.

  You can make the engine render at any 
frame rate you like as long as it doesn't try to display anything. 
However, SDL_Flip() (on a proper target with retrace sync) will lock 
the frame rate to the monitor refresh rate.

Also, since SDL_Delay() and the SDL timers generally have a 
granularity of 10 ms, you can't use those to accurately control the 
frame rate on targets without retrace sync. As long as you want a 
frame rate below 100 Hz, you can "throttle" the game using a mix of 
SDL_Delay() calls and busy-waiting on SDL_GetTicks().
  
 Please don't hard-code "C:\\Program Files", as the
directory has different names depending upon the
region that the OS is configure for.  I know that in
the German version of windows it is called something
else.

In my own project I have the following source file. 
Notice that I can't include the normal headers for my
project, as the shell library includes some crap that
breaks my builds.  Anyway, here is a starting point:

(plus, at work, our "home" folder is really a network
drive.  It follows us around where ever we go. 
Hard-coding a data path to "C:" would not work in this
environment).

  <h2>Configuring SDL</h2>
  <p>
  
  DirectFB : export SDL_VIDEODRIVER=directfb
  
Did you set SDL_AUDIODRIVER to "arts"?
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=3Ddxr3

  
  </p>
1. SDL_DOUBLEBUF implicitly requests a hardware surface in 2D, and this
   isn't always what you want.
2. SDL_DOUBLEBUF has no effect in SDL OpenGL mode.

  
 Accessing internal X11 Display 


SDL_SysWMinfo info;
SDL_VERSION( &info.version );
SDL_GetWMInfo( &info );

info.info.x11.display;


<h2>Using SDL</h2>
  <p>
  you must put sdltest.o before the libraries list,
otherwise the linker doesn't know that SDL functions are needed when it
"reads" libSDL.a and thus doesn't include them. GCC's linker "reads"
link libs and objects from left to right... It won't include function
if it doesn't know that they are needed.

How does one disable the SDL parachute -- or, preferably, have it abort() ?
> That way, I get a core dump and can easily debug it.DL_Init with the SDL_INIT_NOPARACHUTE flag will do it.


you are not allowed to blit to a locked surface

That was actually part of my problem - RedHat already had SDL 
installed from an rpm, and then I installed it myself from source. 
That's how it ended up in two different versions in different places. 
Just something to watch out for!


As you mention you are running RedHat (rpm based), could it be
you have another version of SDL installed f.e. under /usr/lib?


 Under Linux, if the environment variable 
SDL_VIDEODRIVER is set to "dga" (to use the DGA backend), then you need to 
run the program as root. This is a limitation of DGA itself, not SDL or SDL's 
DGA backend. Not running it as root will simply cause SDL to return an error 
stating that it couldn't find any video devices (since it can't use DGA).

So, the solution would be to either run the program as root (bad), or change 
SDL_VIDEODRIVER to "x11" (good).


locate libGL : it looks like you have both the Mesa and NVidia GL libraries installed.
Try removing both (ignore dependencies) and then re-install the NVidia drivers.



Assuming that you're using X Windows, set it to "x11" right before you run 
your program, then check it right after:
	export SDL_VIDEODRIVER="x11"
	./yourprogram
	echo $SDL_VIDEODRIVER

and see what happens.

I needed both SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11 and also
I had to run 'xhost + localhost'

#include "SDL.h", not #include <SDL.h> (that's not portable to the various IDE's supported by SDL)



Currently I have a simple Makefile, I would like to know if there is 
somewhere a simple tutorial or guide about how to create a configure 
file for SDL projects?

Just create "Makefile.am" or copy it from one of the SDL demos. Then run:

$ automake --add-missing    ## Creates Makefile.in
$ autoconf                  ## Creates configure



Blitting through an Intermediary

1. Load the image. (Let's call it tmp.)

	2. Disable alpha blending;
		SDL_SetAlpha(tmp, 0, 0);

	3. For each target surface (tmp2), create an RGBA
	   surface:
		tmp2 = SDL_CreateRGBSurface(SDL_SWSURFACE,
				sw, sh, 32,
				0xff000000, 0x00ff0000,
				0x0000ff00, 0x000000ff);

	3b. Disable alpha blending for the target surface:
		SDL_SetAlpha(tmp2, 0, 0);

	3c. Blit the area(s) you want as usual:
		SDL_BlitSurface(tmp, &rect, tmp2, NULL);

	3d. Enable alpha blending for the target surface:
		SDL_SetAlpha(tmp2, SDL_SRCALPHA | SDL_RLEACCEL,
				SDL_ALPHA_OPAQUE);

	3e. (For performance) convert the surface to a suitable
	    format for blitting to the screen:
		sprite = SDL_DisplayFormatAlpha(tmp2);

And of course, don't forget to SDL_FreeSurface() the temporary 
surfaces. (Note that SDL_DisplayFormat*() creates a new surface 
without freeing the original surface.)

I didn't find a way to detect when user swithces away from prog from the docs

>what is this?

>> could be this the problem?


yes. AFAIK, timers run in a seperate thread, but you should only call
blit operations in the thread that opened the screen. i usually use
SDL_PushEvent to generate a SDL_USEREVENT that i handle in the main
eventloop. there i read the parameters from the event.data fields, so i
know what has to be done and do the blitting stuf.





automake: `configure.ac' or `configure.in' is required

Not that simple.

  It appears I can use seperate threads for rendering 
but have to be able to invoke the SDL equivalent of glXMakeCurrent in each 
additional thread.

Yep. In general, all drawing should be done in the main thread.
http://www.libsdl.org/faq.php?action=listentries&category=2#61

If you really want to do your OpenGL based drawing in a separate thread, you 
can use platform dependent functions (GLX) to make your GL context the 
current context in that thread (glXGetCurrentContext, glXGetCurrentDrawable, 
SDL_GetWMInfo, glXMakeCurrent).

A clever application design implies: use opengl in only ONE thread !


 You just have to make sure that the GL context is current in the thread you're 
doing the rendering from, and you can never attempt two video operations at 
the same time, at least not on the same context (which makes sense; there 
would be too many races involved).
IIRC, you should also be able to render to two different contexts in two different threads simultaneously (e.g. rendering to the screen in one=20
thread, rendering offscreen in another thread). At least in theory...
  </p>
 A separate thread for blitting/flipping video is necessary if you don't want 
to block your main thread.  

If the main thread is blocked for a variable amount of time during 
blits/flips(depending on refresh rate, video card capabilities, etc.), and 
you're dynamically synthesizing audio/video data(such as in an emulator), 
you're going to have to increase the amount of sound you're buffering, which 
increases latency.  With multi-threaded video, if the last video update 
hasn't completed yet and the sound buffer is running low, you can just skip 
that frame update easily.

Try setting the environment variable SDL_VIDEO_CENTERED=1
There's no official API for it yet.

You can specify the environment variable SDL_VIDEO_WINDOW_POS=x,y.
Using 1.2.7, this should work on X11, MacOSX and Windows.


However, you shouldn't turn vsync off, except for testing purposes. Your 
monitor won't display more frames without vsync, but it can cause tearing.
This has also been discussed in the recent past.



License :

Pretty much the rules are:

1) If you're modifying the library itself, all
modifications must be open source.
2) For programs using the library, it must be possible
to insert a different version of the library. This can
be done via:

1) Making the program open source
2) Dynamically linking the library
3) Staticly linking the library, but providing all the
object files necessary to recompile the program with a
different version of that library.
What the license requires you to do depends how you use it.
So here are the possible scenarios:

unmodified dynamically linked SDL
no need to provide anything although it is recommended that you save the 
SDL sources you originally used, so that people can get those from you.

modified dynamically linked SDL
the recommendation above changes to necessity.

statically linked SDL
just as the cases above, but in addition you have to provide the object 
code of your program so that anybody can relink their own version of 
the SDL to your code. You of course can provide the sources instead of 
the object code.



I know that I don't have to make the .o or source code available with my project
if I dynamically link SDL.  However, I can't seem to get around having to link
libsdl_main.a when I compile. (I'm in C++.)  If I link libsdl_main.a to make my
project and then distribute without any .o or source files, am I in violation of
the LGPL?  
 
SDL_main.c, placed in the public domain by Sam Lantinga  4/13/98




If I remember correctly Loki used a hybrid of these cases:
Ie they provided only astatically linked program without the objectcode 
AND the same program as dynamically linked, so that people who wanted 
to  modify the used SDL could do that with the dynamically linked 
version. This way the others got a fully working program without the 
pain of makeing sure that the system has the correct version of SDL 
library.
