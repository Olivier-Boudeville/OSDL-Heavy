I looked at the Binarys after that with lipo -info and they were ppc only, not universal binaries.


I have a build script (SCons-based) that allows me to compile i386

Linux and win32 versions of my game on my Linux box. For building the win32 files, I manually switch the compiler commands to those from Debian's mingw32 package.

Now I'd like to be able to build Mac OS X versions too, for both PPC and Intel
systems. I don't have a Mac myself, so all I can do is try to figure out how
to build the executables and then have friends test the results.

However, I can't seem to find much information on cross-compiling for OS X, and even less for the new Intel systems.

I suggest finding someone willing to donate an SSH account on a OS X
system.

Sourceforge seems to have some OSX machines in their compile farm:
 * ppc-osx1: Apple Mac OS X 10.1 Server with Fink running on an Apple Mac G4
 * ppc-osx2: Apple Mac OS X 10.2 Server with Fink running on an Apple Mac G4

http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=762&group_id=1

Too bad they've been down since October or something  :(

The latest XCode ships with various OS "SDKs", which are the libraries
and headers for a given version of Mac OS X all seperated out, so you
can build for legacy versions no matter what your Mac's actual system
headers and libraries look like. That part is easy.

Also, Apple maintains a public CVS that has their versions of GCC and
binutils source code, and they have the CVS tagged to match the releases
they ship. That part is easy, too.

Putting it all together? That part's a little harder.



Undefined symbols:>  _SDL_Delay  _SDL_GetTicks

I'm guessing you added the SDL framework to the /project/, but not to
your /target/. If you look at the detailed build log for your target,
the link command should include '-framework SDL' somewhere amongst
all the other stuff; if it doesn't, this is definitely your problem.
You can just drag the framework in the appropriate section of your
target in the X-Code tree view, and it should be added in.



the magic incantations under OS X are:

#import <SDL/SDL.h>
#import "SDLMain.h"

#import <Cocoa/Cocoa.h>

/* Portions of CPS.h */
typedef struct CPSProcessSerNum
{
         UInt32          lo;
         UInt32          hi;
} CPSProcessSerNum;

extern OSErr    CPSGetCurrentProcess( CPSProcessSerNum *psn);
extern OSErr    CPSEnableForegroundOperation( CPSProcessSerNum *psn, UInt32 
_arg2, UInt32 _arg3, UInt32 _arg4, UInt32 _arg5);
extern OSErr    CPSSetFrontProcess( CPSProcessSerNum *psn);

void CustomSDLMain()
{
     NSAutoreleasePool  *pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
     [ NSApplication sharedApplication ];
     [ NSApp setMainMenu:[[NSMenu alloc] init] ];

     {
         CPSProcessSerNum PSN;
         /* Tell the dock about us */
         if (!CPSGetCurrentProcess(&PSN))
             if (!CPSEnableForegroundOperation(&PSN,0x03,0x3C,0x2C,0x1103))
                 if (!CPSSetFrontProcess(&PSN))
                     [NSApplication sharedApplication];
     }
}

Call CustomSDLMain before your first call to SDL.


My guess is you are on a G3 and SDL_image was built with -faltivec. 
libpng likes to use setjmp(), which causes GCC to emit code to save the 
Altivec registers when built with -faltivec...unfortunately, this means 
that G3 systems will crash as soon as they call the function with the 
setjmp() in it. I got bit by this right before shipping a game, when I 
added some optimizations and tested on a G3 right before kicking it out 
the door. -faltivec doesn't suggest this sort of subtle nasty in the 
documentation.

The cheapest solution: don't build SDL_image with -faltivec, since 
there's probably no Altivec code in it at all, but you have to make sure 
there's no Altivec code that might execute between the setjmp and 
longjmp calls.

Getting rid of setjmp is another solution, and libpng has hooks for 
this, but this is probably a pain.


I'm building them seperately the Unix Way (using gcc 3.3 for ppc and gcc 4 for x86), and then using the "lipo" command line utility to merge them into one Universal binary.

Are you linking against SDLmain? You shouldn't need to add Mac-specific calls to your SDL program to get basic functionality, but nothing will work right unless SDLmain is used.

  
It seems that 10.2 is the minimum acceptable platform in terms of marketing, at least at this point. I've never had anyone complain that a title didn't work on 10.1.

I'd actually like it to work back to 10.0, but not if it requires lots of work or ugly changes...the public beta, though? That crap can go.
  
  
EVENTTHREAD doesn't work on Mac OS X (and probably shouldn't be used anywhere...maybe we should deprecate that...) 

I do not understand how to include SDLMain.m (I don't know Cocoa or Objective-C). What should I do?
Please read the documentation inside the SDL-1.2.9.dmg. It covers this topic in detail.  

How are you including SDL.h? If you are doing '#include "SDL.h"', as recommended for portability, I think there should be an additional '-I/Library/Frameworks/SDL.framework/Headers'. But as it seems to work for you without that, I left it away.)

SDLMain.m is in /Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/Project Templates/Application/SDL Application/ on my system, but I'm not sure if that's where the latest installer installs it. Search for it.


Don't compile SDL statically into your app. Just copy the SDL.framework and SDL_image.framework to MyApp.app/Contents/Frameworks
as you have read. This is totally independent from Xcode. You can do this in Finder or through the command line.

I don't seem to have SDL.framework or SDL_image.framework as I installed SDL via fink (the 'UNIX' method).

You can download the frameworks from the SDL website.



OSX is one of the OSes where the SDL_INIT_EVENTTHREAD is quite simply not implemented

What is the best way to compile my game or app on Mac OSX so it runs on all versions of OSX ? Do i really need to compile my app with all different OSX SDKs from 10.0 to 10.4 ?

You need to compile it with the lowest common denominator SDK.  If  you want to run on Mac OS X 10.2 and later, then you need to compile  it with the 10.2 SDK.  Pick one, not all of them. I wouldn't bother trying to support 10.0 or 10.1, nobody else does.   I'm not even sure the latest SDL would compile and work correctly on  anything less than 10.2.


I just downloaded the Mac OSX version of SDL-1.2.8. There does not  seem to be
an "SDL.h" file.

Sure there is, it's in /Library/Frameworks/SDL.framework/Headers

Apple's gcc will find it automatically if you reference it as <SDL/SDL.h>

Don't do that.  See
<http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/docwiki.cgi/FAQ_20Including_20SDL_20Headers>.
If the statement

  #include "SDL.h"

doesn't find the appropriate file, your build environment is misconfigured.

Whenever you install SDL onto a unix/linux system, it typically
installs the SDL header files such that they are not directly available
for inclusion. They are put in a folder usually called SDL, usually
within your current include path. Technically in this usual situation,
you could include SDL.h by including SDL/SDL.h as someone else had
suggested. However then, obviously your program won't build on some
systems without making changes (to wit, if you install the SDL
frameworks, you cannot build most SDL software without making changes,
because SDL files have different locations on Mac OS X.) SDL has taken
a more explicit route to help guarantee results. That is, when
installing SDL, a shell script called "sdl-config" is also installed.
You execute this program during your configuration or build phase, and
it will return compiler and linker flags which tell your compiler and
linker where to find SDL headers and libraries. For instance:

$ sdl-config --cflags
-I/opt/local/include/SDL -DTHREAD_SAFE
$ sdl-config --libs
-L/opt/local/lib -lSDL

(Note: you may have noticed -DTHREAD_SAFE, that is the compiler's
command-line option to define a C/C++ preprocessor macro, this is the
second advantage of using a build-process configuration program.)

sdl-config will spit out different values on different systems. It all
depends on where the headers and libraries were installed on the system
in question. The above printout is applicable to having installed SDL
from Darwin Ports (darwinports.opendarwin.org.) This doesn't really
apply to XCode, because XCode makes you create a "project" to get this
information. Mac OS X is a unix system, but they have augmented the
standard way of searching for header-file inclusions, and linking. The
underlying unix way of doing things is still there, but if you
installed the SDL framework, then the unix-typical method of invoking
sdl-config won't work (although, it doesn't appear that you tried to
invoke sdl-config, otherwise that would probably be the problem you're
reporting; it is likely then that you wrote your own SDL test app and
when that didn't work you sent the bug complaint; don't ever make any
assumptions that something going wrong is NOT your fault, you SHOULD
have downloaded someone else's SDL app and tried building it before
reporting the problem as a bug.)

However, recently my hard drive broke on my ibook, and when I
reinstalled SDL on my new system, I used the frameworks as you probably
have, because I wanted to be able to distribute Mac OS X binaries of my
software. So I wrote my own sdl-config script. It's a bit crude, and I
hope to hear some people offer adjustments to it, but in its present
form it gets the job done. Typically I invoke a command-line like this
to build my SDL software:

cc `sdl-config --cflags` -c source1.c
cc `sdl-config --libs` source1.o source2.o -o program

One last thing, if you don't know about linking to SDLmain: google. I'd
type it here but I have to get going. Finally, here is my SDL config
script:

#!/bin/sh

for param in $@
do if [ "$param" = "--cflags" ]
then echo -DTHREAD_SAFE -I/Library/Frameworks/SDL.framework/Headers
-I/Library/Frameworks/SDL_image.framework/Headers
-I/Library/Frameworks/SDL_mixer.framework/Headers
-I/Library/Frameworks/SDL_net.framework/Headers
-I/Library/Frameworks/SDL_console.framework/Headers
else if [ "$param" = "--libs" ]
then echo -framework SDL -framework OpenGL -lobjc -framework Cocoa
-framework QuickTime /Users/donny/SDL-1.2.8/src/main/libSDLmain.a
else if [ "$param" = "--version" ]
then echo 1.2.8
fi
fi
fi
done


I think the SDL installer for Mac OS X should include
both "sdl-config" as well as "libSDLmain.a", instead of
just providing Xcode templates and the source files...

It should be possible to use SDL.framework, without Xcode ?

Especially since it *needs* the non-standard -I flag, and
breaks if you try to include the framework headers directly,
with something like: "#include <SDL_image/SDL_image.h>"...

(Not saying that SDL needs to adopt to any Mac-standards but...
that <SDL/SDL.h> works the same on both systems is pure luck,
for another example see: <GL/gl.h> versus <OpenGL/gl.h> ?)

Since Apple has hacked their GCC to do framework-style paths,
while the others just use directories. (both break on Mac OS 9,
which thinks that the header filename involved is "SDL/SDL.h")


It might also be needed to bring back the "Runtime" (user)
version of the frameworks, since removing the Headers/ and
stripping the shared libraries of the debugging symbols (-S)
saves several hundred KB (!) - which matters since frameworks
will be copied to the Frameworks folder inside the .app bundle.
(The runtime frameworks should be bundled with the application)

And it shouldn't install the developer frameworks to ~/Libraries
either, since Xcode isn't smart enough to recognize such paths
but expands it to e.g. "/Users/afb" - which of course then breaks
on all other machines when trying to open up the project file...
So the best approach is to install devel under /Library/Frameworks,
and just use ~/Library/Frameworks as a fallback for unprivileged ?


I will offer improved installers for SDL on Mac OS 9 / Mac OS X,
as part of the SpriteWorld X project. (http://spriteworldx.sf.net)

Where "OS 9" mostly means CFM, and "OS X" mostly means Mach-O.
The CFM runs fine on OS X too, and the Mach-O could be Darwin...





  
how to compile sdl static on MacOSX ?

I expected to find the typical ".a"-Static-Libray-Files wich i know  from
linux, but all i found
was ".framework". Im using the Xcode-IDE and have no idea how to do  this.
Just build an application and add the framework as a copy  files phase to your application : http://cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000042.php

Be aware that on Mac OS X, the best way to include OpenGL and related header files are like so:
#include <OpenGL/gl.h>
#include <OpenGL/glu.h>
#include <GLUT/glut.h>


It's difficult to correctly build a standalone application when using  Fink dependencies.  When using frameworks, it's trivial to add a copy  frameworks phase and bring in the precompiled frameworks and build a  standalone application correctly.


he breakup between the sdl-devel and sdl packages has changed. This
is intentional. The sdl package now contains a "proper" framework, now
conforming to Apple conventions. This means both the runtime library
and headers are contained in the Framework (as they are supposed to
be). The sdl-dev package contains the documentation and Xcode
templates.

The old behavior of creating a framework, splitting it up into two
separate frameworks, and then putting them into separtate places was
horribly broken and had to die for a significant list of reasons. (If
you have ever done a multiuser setup or zerolink, you might understand
why. The complicated process in doing this operation was probably the
ultimate reason your old sdl_net package refuses to install.) The sdl
frameworks are actually drag-n-dropable,  so I've been wondering if
making a .dmg instead of a package would be better. (The dev-package
is fancy so it will still need a .pkg.)

As for the SDL satellite packages, check the archives. I just posted
on this yesterday. They too are following the proper framework
convention. There is no longer a need for separate dev versions of 
those packages.


There's two ways people like to work on OS X.  Personally, when it comes to development, I enjoy command line and 'fink', which provides necessary library dependencies.

The other, native way, is the frameworks, which can be used from command line compilations by a simple '-framework' (I think) gcc extension.  It does look at the appropriate places for those.

As to SDL, SDL_image etc. you should probably use 'sdl-config' anyhow, instead of fixing the compilation parameters yourself.

If you're doing GUI stuff, using XCode etc. then frameworks are clearly the way to go. 

Actually, there is no sdl-config provided with the framework version
of SDL so that won't work.

You need to include the SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m files directly in your
project so they are compiled with it. You can find these with the
SDL-devel.pkg on the  website. After you install it, start Xcode and
select the create a new SDL application project template. It will
create a simple SDL project for you. Inside you will see that it
copied SDLmain.* into you project. You can modify this project for
your needs or just copy out the SDLmain files into your own project.
(Alternatively, you can search for SDLmain on your system and just add
those files yourself without going through Xcode. If you have
Spotlight, this will be quick  :) 

Also, it's -framework Cocoa and not -framework COCOA (though you might
be able to get away with that since the default filesystem on OS X is
case insensitive).

You should check out the Mac OS X FAQ on the SDL FAQ page:
http://www.libsdl.org/faq.php 

you are using the framework version of SDL (which is the proper way
in OS X, in my humble opinion)

The easiest way to deal with this is to develop your project using
XCode. Once you install the SDL-devel package, you should have a
number of SDL project types to choose from when you create a new
project in XCode. It should set up all the compilation requirements
for you automatically. 

If you really need to use the command line, however, you'll need to
create your own 'sdl-config' script. I wrote a quick version for this
situation, which I keep in ~/bin. For 'sdl-config --cflags' it
outputs:

-F/Users/yourname/Library/Frameworks
-I/Users/yourname/Library/Frameworks/SDL.framework/Headers
-D_REENTRANT

For 'sdl-config --libs' it outputs:

/Users/yourname/bin/SDLMain.o -L/Users/yourname/Library/Frameworks
-framework Cocoa -framework SDL -lobjc

(Both of these outputs are only one line.. and you should adjust them
according to where you installed the SDL framework.)

Finally, you'll notice the SDLMain.o in the --libs output above. I
keep it pre-compiled for simplicity. You just need to grab SDLMain.m,
which is included in the developer stationary that comes with the
SDL-devel package. There are a few versions, use the one from the
"SDL Application" project stationary. Compile it with

   gcc `/path/to/sdl-config --cflags` -c SDLMain.m

to produce the .o file. Everything should work after that.

I use the following command to compile my program:
gcc sdl.c -framework SDL -framework COCOA


Do not do that directly.  Use `sdl-config --cflags --libs` instead, to
substitute the output of sdl-config.


 two different library types, 
Framework vs. dylib (mac os x name for a .so).  Essentially, the Mac OS 
X concept of a shared lib vs the unix concept.  Both are usable, and 
they will both get you the same functioanlity (ie, native window system).

The dylib/so approach will be most familiar to those from a unix 
background.  Put the the sdl dylib in /usr/lib (or /sw/lib if you are 
using fink, as you should be).  Headers are put in /usr/include/SDL (or 
/sw/include/SDL).  You get these downloading the SDL sources and doing a 
configure/make, or using fink.  sdl-config will then be available.

By downloading the Mac OS X dev packages, you got the frameworks. 
Frameworks are a directory (named foo.framework), that contain not only 
the dylib, but also all the headers, and other supporting files. 
Everything related to the framework comes in a single folder, rather 
than scattering files between /usr/lib, bin, include, share, etc.  The 
frameworks do not include sdl-config, because it is unnecessary.

There was recently a discussion about which is best.  I'm just going to 
say go with the Frameworks.  When redistributing your app, place the SDL 
and SDL_image frameworks in YourAppBundle.app/Contents/Frameworks.

As for getting SDL_image and SDL_mixer to work, you'll need frameworks 
for those too.  If binaries are not available, then you can build them 
yourself using xcode.  In the SDL_image,mixer,ttf source distributions, 
there is a file, PBProjects.tar.gz, which contains xcode projects to 
create these.  Place them in ~/Library/Frameworks for ease of 
development, and then put them in AppBundle.app/Contents/Frameworks when 
redistributing your binary.


  
Simpler command line way to create ".dylib" shared libraries : ./configure, make, make install (optional) then some tweaks with install_name_tool to be able to put the dylibs in the directory of the executable.
  
'sdl-config --libs' on MacOSX returning something with '-framework OpenGL' : your program will work just fine without "-framework OpenGL" as long as it doesn't try and use symbols from OpenGL directly, however, there is zero penalty for leaving it in because SDL itself links to OpenGL anyway.

gcc: use fink on MacOSX 

Apple recommends all shipping code be -Os. 

I want to build my game for OS X. SDL shouldn't be statically linked
because my program isn't GPL. Should I use the "framework" or the
UNIX-style shared lib system ?

I'd like to be able to keep SDL in my game's directory, too.

You can build an application with the shared lib, but that would 
probably involve installing the lib into one of the standard system 
paths, which would mean you need an installer (not good on OS X).

Go for the framework.  In XCode, create a 'Copy Files' build phase that 
will copy SDL.framework (and SDL_image.framework, and whatever else), 
into the Frameworks folder inside the bundle.

It also works fine to include the shared library in the Frameworks 
subtree of the bundle.

Assuming it was linked as @executable_path relative, of course.  The 
"developer" framework available from libsdl.org is already linked in 
this manner so it's less of a hassle.

I would tend to recommend bundling the library instead of the framework. 
It seems wasteful to distribute the headers and versioning stuff that a 
framework entails. No reason you couldn't remove the headers and all 
that


Here's how I did it for ut2004 (which may not be the best way, but it 
was the cleanest in the long run, in my opinion):

Build SDL "the unix way"...unpack the source, and from a Terminal:

    cd /where/i/unpacked/SDL-1.2.8
    ./configure
    cd src
    make


Let the thing compile for awhile. When it finishes, one of the last 
things in there should be the link command line...it starts something 
like this...

    gcc -dynamiclib  -o .libs/libSDL-1.2.0.7.1.dylib  .libs/SDL.o

...and runs for 35 lines or so.

Cut and paste that command, making a small change:

  Find:

      -install_name  /usr/local/lib/libSDL-1.2.0.dylib

  Change that to:

      -install_name @executable_path/libSDL-1.2.0.dylib

Take the library (.libs/libSDL-1.2.0.7.1.dylib, on my system) and put it 
into your project. Link against that file. Now the program when run will 
look for "libSDL-1.2.0.dylib" in the same directory as the program.

This is a pain to set up, but is dead simple thereafter, in terms of 
packaging and distribution. Real Mac programmers are probably cringing 
right now and can offer a better solution, but this worked great for me.

That's close enough to the right solution.  You should probably be 
using a different path as per Apple's recommendation 
(@executable_path/../Frameworks/libSDL-1.2.0.dylib), but there is 
nothing technically wrong with yours.  Additionally, rather than 
cutting and pasting 35 lines of junk, you could use 
install_name_tool(1) as a post-process on this dylib (works about 99.5% 
of the time, in some edge cases install_name_tool will fail, but it 
will tell you it failed), or edit the configure script and/or Makefile 
to do this for you.

The Xcode project that SDL comes with will build a framework of this 
style even easier.  Basically, rip open the tarball, go to the 
directory it creates, and type "xcodebuild".  It should be 
preconfigured to build a development-style framework.  I'm not sure how 
people think the library solution is easier (or why you feel the need 
to build it yourself, unless you're patching it, but then you have LGPL 
issues), but whatever floats your boat.



Some may disagree with me, but you really should use the "unix style" 
installation of SDL.

It's very simple to install SDL via Fink (with use of the neat 
FinkCommander GUI) or DarwinPorts from the command line.

http://fink.sourceforge.net/
http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/

If you installed SDL with one of these tools, then you shouldn't need 
to alter your build process at all, it will all build just as though 
you were on Linux or any other Unix.

The .pkg packages are generally for working with XCode.



Basically, after the lib is compiled, you have to type:

install_name_tool -id @executable_path/libSDL.dylib libSDL.dylib 

(I renamed libSDL-1.2.0.7.1.dylib to libSDL.dylib in order to make room
for "@executable_path" since it is longer than "/usr/local/lib". It's
also easier to type  )

And then put this lib into the executable's directory and link against
it. (done by adding "-L." in front of "-L/usr/local/lib" in the linker
flags.)

The otool tool can be used to check that the exe is linked against the
correct lib:

otool -L testprogram


To clarify any possible confusion, we changed what's packaged in the
SDL.framework in the 1.2.8 release. The standard SDL.framework now
contains both the runtime library and the header files. This was done
to bring it in line with Apple conventions. This used to be split into
two frameworks (runtime/headers) which was kind of weird. The header
version went into a user's private framework directory and the runtime
was installed in the system-wide directory. This caused some confusion
with Xcode projects and also caused some headaches for multi-user
systems.

The development package now only contains Xcode/Project Builder
templates and the SDL documentation.



How to dynamically link your application to SDL (dylib vs framework) ? Either way works. I
personally like the framework approach. It's really easy to bundle.
It's all drag and drop. Just copy the SDL.framework to
YourProgram.app/Contents/Frameworks
Check out GLTron or Frozen Bubble. This is how they do it. (Do a "Show
Package Contents" from Finder to see the directory structure inside
the app.)


It would be nice if the sdl site mentionned you have to get the user package in order to develop, and that the developer package is useful
only for Xcode/PowerBuilder. Some more information about how to include
the lib(s) into one's application without linking statically would be
great too for beginners.

I have now recompiled SDL, libpng, libjpeg, libogg, libvorbis, SDL_mixer
and SDL_image, so I'm ready to go. Ah, I still need to
"install_name_tool" some of them
  
  
I have developed an application using SDL for OS X with XCode. Starting 
the application by double clicking on the application works. But when 
starting the program from the command line ("open something.app") I get 
the following errors:

Fet the latest release version from ports using http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/
Or build the latest versions yourself. Or get them via Fink

OSX will not ALWAYS buffer your application's display the same way. Yes it's true, that the window composition layer (not the 
window manager) does create the image of your window off-screen and in 
that sense there is a second display buffer, but without actually 
requesting double buffering, there are two possible behaviors for the 
window composition layer:

a) composition that is asynchronous with your application
b) you get real hardware access to the portion of the screen occupied 
by your window, no buffering at all

In Jaguar I've been told you get B. I use panther, and I get A.

  
So basically want you want to be able to do is click
an icon, and have the graphical portion of the
application show without the stdio?

You may want to learn more about the .app structure of
typical OS X applications. I don't know much about
them, only what I've seen from browsing their
contents. But I just tried this in an attempt to give
you a simple answer, and it works fine for my
application:

$ mkdir some-app.app
$ mkdir some-app.app/Contents
$ mkdir some-app.app/Contents/MacOS
$ cp some-app some-app.app/Contents/MacOS/some-app

Then just double click the icon that shows up in the
finder. Some quirks about doing this:

 - You cannot drag the application icon to your dock.
Instead, run it, get into windowed mode if it starts
in full screen, then right click its icon on the dock
and select "Keep in Dock"

 - The default Project Builder icon is used until you
add an icon. I don't know how to do this, if you find
out how, or see a good page about the .app structure,
please let me know at smirk@thebuicksix.com.

Please let me know how this works for you! (Btw I'm
running Panther, in case that becomes an issue.)

No there is no such way; the "console" is just another program like any 
other. But if you just want to be able to see debug output, there are 
two simple ways:
1) Use Console.app
2) Simply start Terminal.app (or any other terminal application of your 
choice), and manually start your application from there; then you'll be 
able to see the output. E.g. if I want to run ScummVM.app, I can do 
this:
   cd /path/to/ScummVM.app/Contents/MacOS/
   ./scummvm
   
   Unable to open :src:main:macos:SDL_main.c or so because it is not a text file ?!?!?

Were the '\n' returns correctly converted to the Mac-style when you
downloaded it?





I created a symbolic link. This is an ugly hack for compiling OpenGL applications from the
command-line on OSX, no other solution seems to work : 

 ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Headers GL
 
 or 
 
 change the #include's as follows:

# include <OpenGL/gl.h>
# include <OpenGL/glu.h>

and then add "-framework OpenGL" instead of "-lgl -lglu"

OS X frameworks are useful if you're using OS X's XCode or Package 
Builder to build your app. Of course you would want to put the 
framework inside your application bundle, rather than requiring the 
user to install it into /Libraries/Frameworks .

OS X frameworks are not useful if you want to build an existing 
autoconf-based project. In this case, you should use a Unix-like SDL 
package, such as those installed by Fink or DarwinPorts. These install 
sdl-config and libraries just like Linux/BSD/etc packages (but into /sw 
or /opt), which means that build systems depending on sdl-config "just 
work".

However, you cannot assume that users have installed the 
Fink/DarwinPorts package on their own systems, so you should statically 
link with SDL. You cannot use the linker's -static argument (you cannot 
statically link with OS X's system libraries; see 
http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1118.html). Instead you must 
link by directly referencing the .a files, e.g. "gcc mycode.o 
/sw/lib/libSDL.a -o mycode". In SDL 1.2.7, OS X's "sdl-config 
--static-libs" will emit the correct output, but in earlier versions 
this was not the case. However, I notice that sdl.m4 (as found in 
SDL-1.2.7 source) does not seem to support --static-libs, so this will 
require custom autoconf hacking. Anyone want to comment on that?

It's important to note that statically linking SDL is not possible for 
commercial programs (because of the LGPL license). One alternative to 
static linking, which Ryan Gordon used in UT2003, is to dynamically 
link with SDL but include libSDL.dylib in the application bundle 
itself. In this case you must somehow link with 
"@executable_path/libSDL.dylib" (as seen in "otool -L <executable>", 
but I don't know how to do this. It may require building your own 
libSDL.dylib, and specifying the "install path" as "@executable_path".

Essentially, yes, but with a special structure. And it's important that  
you care about the lib dependencies, too. For this reason, I always  
static link my release binaries, that way, there is no hassle with  
installing SDL libs. Your users will hate you if you force stuff like  
that on them .

Some information about this topic can be round in README.MacOSX, you  
should consult that first. Then, as am example, this is what  
ScummVM.app looks like:

$ tree ScummVM.app/
ScummVM.app/
`-- Contents
     |-- Info.plist
     |-- MacOS
     |   `-- scummvm
     |-- PkgInfo
     `-- Resources
         `-- scummvm.icns

We create it with a simple hand written build rule. Look at this:  
<http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/scummvm/scummvm/ 
Makefile?content-type=text%2Fplain&rev=1.65>
So no black magic...

The "Info.plist" file is an almost static XML file. In the case of SDL,  
it is indeed fully static and in our CVS:
<http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/scummvm/scummvm/ 
Info.plist?content-type=text%2Fplain&rev=1.13.2.5>
For exult, it is instead created from an "Info.plist.in" file which we  
pass through sed to replace some stings (@VERSION@ for example).

The icon file is in the .icns format, you can find plenty of  
information about it on the net; also apple ships an icon editor for  
that format, as well as the 'tiff2icns' CLI util. There are converters  
from/to .ico etc. available somewhere on the net, too.

Oh yes, you might notice a special target in the ScummVM Makefile,  
which is used to generate a special static linked binary. Two notes:
1) If you use autoconf/automake, obviously you'll want to do this  
differently. Exult also uses automake, but so far I haven't gotten  
around of creating an "exult-static" target for it; I'll do that  
eventually, though
2) We use "`sdl-config --static-libs`", but note that this only works  
correctly starting with SDL 1.2.7 ! I strongly recommend using SDL  
1.2.7 when working on Mac OS X.

Good mac apps do not need an installer. They are installed by drag &  
drop. So a typical distribution format is to pack your application, the  
docs, etc., into a folder; then either compress that folder (as a .sit,  
or if you don't make use of resource forks, you could also use .zip);  
or nowadays even more common, people create a .dmg disk image file  
(with Apple's "Disk Copy", resp. "Disk Utility" tool, or with  
equivalent CLI commands). You then put your app on that virtual disk,  
and distribute the .dmg file.



Codewarrior

1) create a new project -> Mac OS X Cocoa Stationary -> Objective-C++
Application (I read somewhere that SDL needs to be a Cocoa app);

2) add the SDL framework to the project;

3) add the OpenGL framework to the project if you need it for your app;

4) add the files SDLMain.h & SDLMain.m to the project, you can get them from the
cvs (http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/SDL12/src/main/macosx/). They are
normally part of a new ProjectBuilder project, but we need to add them manually;

5) remove main.mm which was automatically created by codewarrior and add your
own cpp files;

6) optional step: you can also remove MainMenu.nib from the project.

7) compile and enjoy.....


I'm trying to get MP3s playing on Mac OS X using SDL_mixer + SMPEG.
When I load the MP3 file I get the message "Warning: incorrect audio
format," and then the audio sounds really bad. This appears to be some kind of endian issue. I first tried re=EBncoding the MP3 with a
sample-rate matching the parameter I gave when initializing SDL_mixer.

The sound was improved, but it's still horribly messed-up.

Here's how I built SMPEG and SDL_mixer with XCode:

I converted both the SDL_mixer and SMPEG PB projects to XCode using the

"Upgrade All Targets to Native" command and added the appropriate
Header Search Paths. I then built and installed the SMPEG framework.
Before building SDL_mixer I got rid of the smpeg.framework that was
lurking in SDL_mixer's "pkg-support" folder. I also added -DMP3_MUSIC
to the "Other C Flags" in SDL_mixer's target settings for MP3 support.

My experience is that you can change that explicit path that Xcode
inserted when you added the framework to
"$(HOME)/Library/Frameworks/SDL.framework" afterwards, and things continue
to work. This could be a way to make the templates user-independent.
