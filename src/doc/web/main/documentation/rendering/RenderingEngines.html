I was looking for 3D engines a while ago and concluded the Ogre engine was
the best overall.  I tried it for a few days and gave up after concluding
the documentation didn't go in-depth enough.

Irrlicht : 

The pros:
Very easy
Works on windows and linux, no dependencies (it is supposed to work even
if DX isnt installed)
Loads file formats without any conversion (no exporters/converters
needed)
XML parser included, nice GUI
Material system is being redone, will support shaders for next release.
Contras:
Unmature
Some design flaws
Can only load anims from md2, X and milskshape files.
Lack of features (like submeshing)
Support for Q3 BSPs is incomplete
GUI isnt customizable

If you are an experienced 3d developer I would recommend you using Ogre.

Torque engine (used to make Tribes) : one of the most complete and proven game engines out there for the price ($100).And you get full source code.
