There is a major difference between large enterprise APP databases 
and GAME databases.  Because of the "really real time" nature of games, you 
can't really wait around for a few seconds for things to go directly to a 
database.  And this is pretty obvious (even before the talk), as is the 
fact that there has to be something going on in the backend to facilitate 
real time data access.  So they have a "game state" proxy server that sits 
between the game servers and the database server, and this will receive 
game state updates, and return game state information and then regularly 
write out "snapshots" of the game world to the database.  And this is good 
because if your game server goes down you still have the state, and 
etc.
