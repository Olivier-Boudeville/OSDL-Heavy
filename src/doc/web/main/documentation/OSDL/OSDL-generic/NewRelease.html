<h1>How to prepare an update of a member of OSDL's family</h1>

<h2>Preparing new versions and releases</h2>

<p>
At first, one must use the right terms, which are to be understood regarding our project's own conventions and Sourceforge's ones: in <code>OSDL-0.3.17</code>, <code>OSDL</code> is the package name, <code>0.3</code> is the version (made from a major version number, <code>0</code>, and a minor version number, <code>3</code>), which is also known to Sourceforge as a <em>file release</em>, and <code>17</code> designates the (sub)release number.
</p>
  
<p>
The result of new versions, releases and subreleases can be viewed in Sourceforge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71354#files" target="_blank">download area</a> for OSDL.
</p>


<h3>Checklist for a new version</h3>
    
<p>Here are some steps in order to prepare relatively painlessly a new version of an OSDL's family member (please note that a few of these steps necessitate to be a <a href="../../../project/howToContribute/ContributionGuide.html#member">registered OSDL member</a>).
</p>

<p>
We now rely on the <a href="http://ceylan.sourceforge.net/Ceylan-latest/Ceylan-developerguide.html#newrelease" target="_blank">release method</a> we described in Ceylan's developer guide. One just has to replace a mention to Ceylan by a mention to OSDL.
