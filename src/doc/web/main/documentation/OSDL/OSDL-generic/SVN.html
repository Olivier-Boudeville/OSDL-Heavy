<h1>OSDL's SVN policies</h1>
  
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This document concentrates on the way OSDL uses SVN services.
</p>

  
<h2>Choices</h2>
<p>
Every OSDL's source file (code, but also documentation, web page and so on) is to be registered under SVN.
</p>

<p>
The reasons for their storing in control version are:
<ol>
	<li>avoiding <b>loosing</b> them: there is nothing as painful in development when sources are lost. SourceForge's servers are reliable and regularly archived. And thanks to SVN, many people who performed a checkout of our sources have their own copies.</li>
	<li>keeping all the <b>versions</b> available: for every file, every version can be retrieved, thus all thier history can be used, allowing roll-backs.</li>
	<li><b>sharing</b> the sources: control versions systems allow users to work collaboratively on a project, in a groupware-fashion</li>
</ol>

<p>
However, as opposed to source file, no generated file (like objects <code>[*.o, *.lo]</code>, libraries <code>[*.a, *.la, *.so]</code> or executables) should be versioned, since they are to be rebuilt using the sources. Furthermore their size is often significant.
</p>

	<li>the second <b>one</b> in our project server, which is scarcely up-to-date [<a href="http://osdl.dnsalias.com/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/" target="_blank">browse</a>]</li>
</ul>

<p>
OSDL is based on Ceylan, whose counterpart SVN informations are <a href="http://ceylan.sourceforge.net/Ceylan-latest/Ceylan-developerguide.html#ceylansvn" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>


<h2>Accessing our main repository</h2>

<p>
To perform a check-out of all sources, just use:
<center>
    <table summary="Code" style="border : none">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="box">
<code><pre>
svn co https://osdl.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/osdl osdl
</pre></code>
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</center>
</p>



<h3>Quick overview of the structure of our SVN repository</h3>

<p>
Basically, the work (development, documentation, and so on) being made by the OSDL team (including our club for game creation) respects the following structure:
<ul>

	<li><b>OSDL</b>: our generic multimedia library</li>
	
	<li><b>Tools</b>: some tools we had to develop or improve for our own needs (such as yag-osdl) </li>

<!--
	<li><b>Trailer</b>: what we specifically created for our first game's trailer</li>
	<li><b>club</b>: some work necessary for our game creation club</li>
-->
	
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Dealing with security and user-friendly approach</h3>
<p>
By default, each operation involving the SourceForge's repository triggers a SSH-handshake that leads to the asking of the user's password. As oftenly many SVN operations have to be chained, it becomes a growing pain to have to type one's password many times. 
</p>

<p>
There is hopefully a quick work-around described <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=761&group_id=1" target="_blank">here</a>, which allows to export one's public key to SourceForge' servers. That way, one's machine can self-authenticate the user without any password being typed, allowing a more user-friendly SVN usage. 
</p>


<!--
<h2>Some SVN-related hints</h2>


<h3>Updating one's repository</h3>
<p>
One should perform on a regular basis (i.e. at least before modifying anything under the local check-out directory) an update, which makes sure that the local files are up-to-date with regard to the SVN repository, therefore hindering users to work on an obsolete version of the file, which would result in a painful merge to be done. 
</p>

<p>
To perform this update, use this command: 
  <center>
 <table summary="SVN update" class="c1" style="border: none">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <div class="box">
          <code>cvs -z3 -d:ext:hurricane@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/osdl update -d</code> 
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center> 
  
 <center>- or, preferably -</center>
  
   <center>
 <table summary="SVN update" class="c1" style="border: none">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <div class="box">
          <code>cvsosdl update -d</code>
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
  </p>
  
<p>
The reason for the <code>-d</code> option is that, without it, any newly created directory in the repository would not be copied back.
</p>


<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>
Each time a major modification of the SVN repository is being made, one should inform the other SVN users of the change, so that they will not forget to perform an update.
</p>


<p>
Another important point is to ensure that stable releases are tagged, so that at any time one can roll-back to a working set of source files. To do so recursively, from within a stable checkout directory, use:

<center>
    <table summary="SVN tag" class="c1" style="border: none">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <div class="box">
         <code>cvs tag STABLE_yyyymmdd</code>
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
  
	<center>for instance: </center>
<center>
	
    <table summary="SVN tag example" class="c1" style="border: none">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <div class="box">
         <code>cvs tag STABLE_20040227</code> for 2004, February 27.
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>
</p>


<p>
Thus, the rule of thumb might be: ensure that the recommendations of the <a href="../../../download/Download.html" target="_blank">Download page</a> are always applicable.
</p>


<h3>SVN limitations</h3>
<p>
SVN is a useful tool, but has some defects that hopefully his replacements (ex: <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_blank">Subversion</a>) won't inherit.
</p>

<p>
The most annoying drawback of SVN is that it is not possible from its clients to remove a directory on the repository. If file deleting is easy (<code>cvs rm myFile</code> after having removed your corresponding local checkouted file), the only way of getting rid of a directory is to log on the SVN server and to manually perform deletings in the repository directly.
</p>

<p>
As it is not possible to log on SourceForge's SVN servers, there exist only two solutions to correct a mistake involving a directory (see the <a href="#cvsReminder">import</a> section to understand how easy it is to make mistakes):
 <ul>
	<li>usually, <b>do nothing</b>: remove recursively by hand (<code>cvs rm</code>) all files in the directory, leaving a tree of empty directories, and wait till the next project's version, which should be cleaned up of those directories before being imported again</li> 
	<li>for big cases: issue a <b>SVN project request support</b> to SourceForge team, who will hopefully spoil a bit of their time correcting manually one's project repository</li>	
 </ul>
</p>

<h3>A useful reminder about cvs import</h3>

<p>Less SVN repositories should be bungled by mistake with the import
command thanks to that reminder taken from <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/software/cvs/manual/html_mono/cvs.html"
   target="_blank">SVN' manual</a>:
</p>

<center>
  <table summary="SVN informations" class="c1" style="border: none">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <div class="box">
          <code>If the files you want to install in SVN reside in
          `wdir', and you want them to appear in the repository as
          `$SVNROOT/yoyodyne/rdir', you can do this:<br>
          <br>
          $ cd wdir<br>
          $ cvs import -m &quot;Imported sources&quot; yoyodyne/rdir
          yoyo start<br>
          <br>
          Unless you supply a log message with the `-m' flag, SVN
          starts an editor and prompts for a message. The string
          `yoyo' is a vendor tag [i.e. put you user name here], and `start' is a release tag.
          They may fill no purpose in this context, but since SVN
          requires them they must be present.</code>
        </div>
	</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
After having imported a tree, one should make vanish its root directory (ex: <code>mv myRootDirectory myRootDirectory-putInSVN</code>) and perform an update (<code>cvs update -d</code>). Then only one's will have the previously imported tree with all SVN metadata (<code>SVN</code> directories) copied.

</p>

<p>After having checked the import is a success (the right content in the right place), one can safely remove completely one's private copy (<code>rm -rf myRootDirectory-putInSVN</code>). If something went wrong, some <code>cvs rm</code> black-magic will be needed.


</p>


<p>If I had read more attentively that previous import command's
description, I would not have bungled OSDL-0.1 SVN branch, forcing us
to release sooner than expected an OSDL-0.2 version !</p>

<h3>Using SVN from Windows</h3>
<p>
Although it is not the preferred way of having SVN working, one can use it under the Windows OS. A careful reading of those SourceForge's documents might help:
