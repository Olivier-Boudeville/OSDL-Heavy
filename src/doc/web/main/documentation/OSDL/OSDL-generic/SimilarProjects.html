<h1>A general view of multimedia libraries</h1>

<p>Whenever we happen to find similar projects (i.e. helping libraries, not projects such as games that use it, it is another
section), we try to put them in our list, with a link and a tiny comment. We nevertheless do not aim to be exhaustive (it would be a
full-time job). Most of these projects seem more advanced than OSDL. Feel free to help
us by <a href="mailto:olivier.boudeville@online.fr?subject=[OSDL]%20New%20project%20spotted%20!">
adding similar projects</a> that you know of !</p>


<p>Projects are sorted alphabetically.</p>


<table border="1" summary="Other spotted projects">

	<td align="center"><a href="http://www.nongnu.org/adgali/index.html"
	target="_blank">Adgali<br>
	(Advanced Game Library)</a></td>

	<td>Adgali is a library made to enhance the features of low level
	libraries for game or mutimedia development, like SDL. A french
	hobby project, like OSDL !</td>

	<td align="center">GPL</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
	<td align="center"><a href="http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/"
	target="_blank">Allegro</a></td>

	<td>Another full-featured library for C/C++ developers,
	supporting DOS, Unix (Linux, FreeBSD, Irix, Solaris), Windows,
	QNX, and BeOS (MacOS port is in alpha stage). Numerous games use
	it, a whole community is gathered around Allegro.</td>

	<td align="center">Gift-ware</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
	<td align="center"><a href="http://cleangl.sourceforge.net/"
	   target="_blank">CGL<br>
	(Clean Game Library)</a></td>

	<td>A complete development system for 2D games using a rather
	disturbing functional language called Clean.</td>

	<td align="center">LGPL</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
	<td align="center"><a href="http://www.clanlib.org/" target=
	"_blank">Clanlib Game SDK</a></td>

	<td>This multi-platform game development library abstracts
	display, sound, input, networking, files, threadding and such in
	a C++ platform independant way, and offers a whole framework in
	order to make game development easier. OSDL is aimed at similar
	purposes, and would wish to go as much as high level as possible.
	Clanlib is already a full featured framework used by many GPL
	games.</td>

	<td align="center">LGPL</td>
  </tr>

	<td align="center"><a href="http://easygamelib.sourceforge.net/"

	<td align="center"><a href=
	"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/default.aspx"
	   target="_blank">Microsoft&#39;s DirectX</a></td>

	<td>The major SDK used for PC (and now XBox) game development. By
	far the most widely spread and known, it nevertheless only
	supports some Microsoft&#39;s operating system&#39;s flavours,
	and no other operating system. Very far from open source&#39;s
	way of thinking. Huge means. The APIs (used to ?) change a lot
	from a version to the next.</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
	<td align="center"><a href="http://www.opengl.org/" target=

	already in OSDL&#39;s site (remember ?)</td>

	<td align="center">LGPL</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
	<td align="center"><a href="http://plib.sourceforge.net/" target=
	"_blank">PLIB</a></td>

	<td>This portable library includes sound effects, music, a
	complete 3D engine, font rendering, a GUI, networking, 3D math
	library and a collection of handy utility functions. Based upon
	OpenGL. Many games use it.</td>

	<td align="center">LGPL</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
	<td align="center"><a href="http://www.libsdl.org/" target=
	"_blank">SDL<br>
	(Simple DirectMedia Library)</a></td>

	<td>The famous library from Sam Lantiga, on top of which OSDL is
	built. Powerful, low level, with a huge number of supported
	platforms, numerous games using it, and a very active community.
	SDL has been used by many GPL and commercial games (Loki&#39;s
	ports to Linux)</td>
