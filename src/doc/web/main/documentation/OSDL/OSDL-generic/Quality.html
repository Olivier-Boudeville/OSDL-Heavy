<h1>Ensuring quality of OSDL releases</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This document concentrates on some common quality rules which should be enforced by the OSDL project, on a best-effort basis. 
</p>


<h2>Some coding conventions</h2>

<p>
Some of them can be found in <a href="http://ceylan.sourceforge.net/main/documentation/CodingConventions.html" target="_blank">Ceylan's coding conventions</a> (some parts in French).
</p>
  
  
<a name="testing"></a>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>
We do our best to torture-test, as far as possible, the whole LOANI's tool chain before releasing a new version. With this test suite, both the auto-installation script LOANI and the Ceylan and OSDL C++ libraries are validated, thanks to the numerous executables tests that are built alongside.
</p>

<p>
We run through the whole process on the following hardware and software configurations, which happen to be varied and, we hope, representative of the users' configurations (various technological generations, processors, video cards, kernels, and distributions):

<p>
We have access to two other sets of computers as well, even though we test our developments on their platforms less frequently. These are two <em>compile farms</em>, kindly provided by:
<ul>


    <li><a href="http://www.testdrive.hp.com/" target="_blank">Hewlett Packard</a>, which provides a dedicated <a href="http://www.testdrive.hp.com/current.shtml" target="_blank">Testdrive 
compile farm</a> with more than 30 hosts</li>

    <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net" target="_blank">Sourceforge</a>, which used to provide its dedicated <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docs/compile_farm#hosts" target="_blank">12-host compile farm</a>. Sadly they discontinued this useful service</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>
Thanks to these structures, we believe we have access to most operating system/system type/processor for UNIX-based architectures.
</p>



<h3>Full testing process</h3>

<p>
For each new test, our process is to create a brand new user (<code>adduser tester</code>) and to behave exactly as a new LOANI user would behave (<code>su - tester</code>): install everything thanks to <a href="../../../../OSDL-latest/LOANI.html">LOANI</a>, and run the full test suite thanks to <code>playTest.sh</code>.
</p>

<p>
That way, we can get rid of side-effects such as configuration files (ex: <code>.*rc</code>) or shell environment (ex: does the user include '.' in his <code>PATH</code> ?). It allows us to feel a little bit more confident with our tests, since we closely emulate OSDL's average user.
</p>

<p>
With tests made regularly with different other GNU/Linux machines, we believe that this platform is well supported. We fully ported Ceylan and OSDL to Windows (notably XP), and we fix from time to time the Windows build (due to the new code coming from Linux), notably before new release. We ported a while ago both libraries to BSD systems (FreeBSD, OpenBSD mainly).
</p>

<p>
For the other platforms (we target Mac OS X and others), a port is still to be done, but it should mostly impact Ceylan, since OSDL relies on cross-platform tools. If you would have liked testing Ceylan and OSDL on those platforms, <a href="mailto:osdl-rfe@esperide.com?subject=[OSDL]%20Other%20platforms">send us a mail</a> !
</p>
  

<h2>Other quality concerns</h2>

<h3>Website</h3>
<p>
From time to time, we check our website for dead links, thanks to the W3C <a href="http://validator.w3.org/checklink" target="_blank">Link Checker</a> tool, with a recursion depth of 10.
</p>
