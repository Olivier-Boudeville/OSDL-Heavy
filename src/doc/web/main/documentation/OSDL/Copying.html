<h2>Long version</h2>

<h3>LGPL</h3>
<p>
Since 2002, January, 11, the <code>Objet oriented Simple DirectMedia Layer
Library</code> (in short, OSDL) is available under the GNU Lesser
General Public License (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html" target="_blank">LGPL</a>) version 2 or newer.
</p>

<p>This license allows you to link with the library in such a way that users can modify the library and have your application use the new version, both for non-commercial and commercial use.
</p>
  
<p>To comply with this license, you must give prominent notice that you use the Object-oriented Simple DirectMedia Layer library, and that it is included under the terms of the LGPL license. You must include a copy of the LGPL license (see the <a href="http://osdl.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/osdl/OSDL/trunk/src/doc/basic/OSDL-COPYING.LIB-template.txt.in?view=markup" target="_blank">OSDL-COPYING.LIB-template.txt.in</a> text file in the OSDL distribution).
 You must also do one of the following:
 <ol>
	  <li>Include the source code for the version of OSDL that you link with, as well as the full source or object code to your application so that the user can relink your application,
      </li>
	  <li>or include a written offer, valid for at least three years, to provide the materials listed in option 1, charging no more than the cost of providing this distribution,
      </li>
      <li>or make the materials listed in option 1 available from the same place that your application is available.
      </li>
  </ol>   
</p>

<p>The most common way to comply with the license is to dynamically link with OSDL, and then include the OSDL source code and appropriate notices with your application.
</p>  



<h3>GPL</h3>
<p>
Since Tuesday, October 23, 2007, OSDL is <b>also</b> available under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" target="_blank">GNU GPL</a> license version 2 or newer. </p>

<p>
That has been done notably to allow to use OSDL with the Helix decoder in a fully GPL scheme [More infos on <a href="OSDL-generic/Helix-OSDL/helix-osdl.html">Helix-OSDL</a>].
</p>



<h3>Informations &amp; other tools</h3>

<p>
  Note that OSDL makes use of a few open source libraries, notably the <a href="http://www.libsdl.org" target="_blank">Simple DirectMedia Library</a> (SDL), which is released under the LGPL license as well.
</p>

<p>
See our <a href="../gameExplained/Licenses.html">point about licenses</a> and our <a href="FAQ/FAQ.html">FAQ</a> for more informations on this topic.
</p>

<p>
Most other tools developed for the OSDL project (ex: LOANI, YAG-OSDL) are released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" target="_blank">GNU GPL</a> license version 2 or newer.
