  <p>Both developers and end-users can obtain OSDL from at least five ways, listed in decreasing interest order:
<br>
  <ul>
    <li>our famous <b>Lazy OSDL Automatic Net Installer</b>, LOANI. It is the recommended and easy way for installing everything relevant (Ceylan, OSDL and all their own pre requesites)
		<ul>
		
    		<li>see <a href="../../OSDL-latest/LOANI.html" target="_blank">LOANI's documentation</a></li>
			
    		<li>get LOANI: <a href="LOANI-0.3.zip">LOANI-0.3.zip</a> or <a href="LOANI-0.3.tar.gz">LOANI-0.3.tar.gz</a></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	
    <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71354"
    target="_blank">Files released by the project</a> at <b>Sourceforge</b>:  full archives of the source of our libraries are regularly placed there, often when a new version or a new release becomes available</li>

	<li>using our project <b>FTP server</b>: our server is available through anonymous access at <a href="ftp://ftp.esperide.com/LOANI-archive-repository" target="_blank">ftp://ftp.esperide.com/LOANI-archive-repository</a>, and acts usually as a mirror of Sourceforge's file services</li>

    <li>using <b>CVS</b> directly: <a href="#cvs">read our nano-guide</a> [<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/osdl/" target="_blank">browse our CVS on SourceForge</a>]. Prefer retrieving a stable tag (such as <code>STABLE_yyyymmdd</code>) since cutting-edge CVS tree is often broken during the development process</li>

    <li><b>Nightly CVS Tarballs</b>: each night, a fresh bzip2-compressed .tar archive of the complete contents of OSDL's CVS repository is generated. Each tarball contains the exact contents that are found on the CVS server, including all RCS files for all modules within that repository and all CVS control files within the CVSROOT for that repository. [<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/osdl-cvsroot.tar.bz2">Download latest nightly CVS Tarballs</a>] (<code>osdl-cvsroot.tar.bz2</code>)</li>
	
  </ul>

In case of trouble, please consult our <a href="../documentation/OSDL/OSDL-0.3/LOANI.html#support">support section</a>, where issues ought to be solved.

<h2>Our CVS nano-guide</h2>

  <h3>Getting OSDL and related directly from our CVS tree</h3>

  <p>OSDL's CVS repository can be checked out through anonymous
  (pserver) CVS with the following instruction set. 
  
  
  <h4>Getting OSDL as a pure end-user</h4>
  <p>
  In this case, one just wants all the necessary sources and does not intend to make any change which would have to be backported to our CVS. No CVS information is needed, therefore the <code>export</code> command should be used. One has only to issue:</p>
  
</p>

    <table summary="CVS export" style="border: none">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <div class="box">
          <code>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/osdl export -Dtomorrow Ceylan OSDL</code>
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  
  
  </p>When prompted for a
  password for anonymous, simply press the Enter key. </p>
  
  <p>
  With this method, one would have the "latest" CVS snapshot of our projects. Not so "latest" however, since Sourceforge's CVS are mirrored. Anonymously-accessed repositories have a constant offset of a few hours: data is currently synchronized between the developer CVS servers (SSH) and the anonymous CVS servers (pserver) every 5 hours. There may be a delay of up to five hours between the time a developer commits a file and when it becomes available via pserver.
  </p>

<p>
Besides, end users are merely interested in stable releases, whereas our latest CVS snapshot is often in broken compile state: while we are working on a project, we iterate from a stable release to another one, but the main part of the time, between them, the work in progress does not behave well by construction. Therefore, as much as possible, we tag stable releases with their date, according to the following conventions: <code>STABLE_yyyymmdd</code>, like <code>STABLE_20040227</code>, for 2004, February 27. Thus, if one wants to retrieve from CVS the latest stable release of our project, he could:
<ol>
	<li><b>peer</b> into our <a href=
    "http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/osdl/" target=
    "_blank">anonymous CVS on SourceForge</a> </li>
	<li><b>find</b> the lastest stable release tag (ex: STABLE_20040227)</li>
	<li><b>get</b> the version corresponding to that tag, thanks to:

    <table summary="CVS tag" style="border: none">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <div class="box">
        <code>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/osdl co -r &lt;my found tag&gt; &lt;the module I target&gt; </code> 
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>	
	
	
	<center>for instance: </center>
	
    <table summary="CVS tag example" style="border: none">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <div class="box">
         <code>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/osdl co -r STABLE_20040227 Ceylan/Ceylan-0.2</code>
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  	
	 </li>
	<li>he would then end up with the latest complete stable release</li>
</ol>

  
</p>

  
  <p>To have a working installation, we hereby assume that all other software OSDL's pre
  requesites, not depending of OSDL's project, will be available before one compiles our library (for instance, SDL should be installed prior to OSDL).
  
  </p>
  
  
    <h4>Getting OSDL as a potential developer</h4>
  <p>
  In this case, one wants all informations, including CVS metadata, and the <code>checkout</code> (co) command is to be used. One might want to select the module(s) to retrieve. A good start would be to replace in the command below <code>modulename</code> by <code>Ceylan OSDL</code>. To perform more accurate CVS retrieval, one can determine all the names of the modules created for our project, by examining our
  CVS repository via the <a href=
  "http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/osdl/" target=
  "_blank">provided web-based CVS repository viewer</a>. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  
  The module you wish
  to check out must be specified as the modulename. When prompted for a
  password for anonymous, simply press the Enter key. 
  
  </p>
  
  <p>To retrieve modulename from our CVS server, please enter (do not
  forget to substitute modulename with the name of the module you want
  to check out):</p>
  
  <table summary="CVS co" style="border: none">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <div class="box">
          <code>Just once, to start your CVS session:<br>
          cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/osdl
          login<br>
          Then, for every module to retrieve:<br>
          cvs -z3
          -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/osdl co
          modulename</code>
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  
  <br>
  <br>
