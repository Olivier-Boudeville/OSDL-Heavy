<h1>Developer Guide for the OSDL 0.5 version</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The intended public for this document is OSDL <b>developers</b>, i.e. working on the library itself: OSDL <b>users</b> ought to refer to the <a href="OSDL-userguide.html">OSDL User Guide</a>.
</p>

<p>This developer's guide is still to be written, however here are a few hints about OSDL's inner working.</p>

  
<p>See also: <a href="http://ceylan.sourceforge.net/Ceylan-latest/Ceylan-developerguide.html" target="_blank">Ceylan developer's guide</a> for common informations.

<a name="conventions"></a>  
<h2>Conventions</h2>
  
 
<h3>Overall conventions</h3>
<p>
For some transverse subjects, such as the anti-aliasing mode (wanted or not), at least two ways of managing these informations were possible, having them static or not:
<ul>
	<li>If they were <b>static</b> to their module (ex: VideoModule), then their access would be easy, but if this module which behaves like a singleton was finally due to be able to be instanciated multiple times (ex: if the video back-end allowed, with its upcoming version, to open multiple windows), then some rewriting would have to be done</li>
	<li>If they were <b>non-static</b>, then they would be relative to a particular module (instance members of that object), which would gracefully scale if, instead of one, there were two or more of these modules. However, each time one of the overall attributes is to be used, instead of being simply referenced thanks to a global symbol (say, <code>OSDL::VideoModule::GetAntialiasingState</code>), a specific instance of a module would have  to be used and, therefore, passed in some way to its caller. It would imply adding arguments to most methods or, preferably, use a kind of state machine where, unless specified otherwise, there would be a current instance of module to which operations would be applied.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
The first solution was preferred, since the 'singleton to many instances' transition could be performed with a state machine indeed, but the call to static methods could handle that internally without needing to perform tremendous changes in the code that uses these features: that change could be transparent for user code.
</p>
  
<h4>Endianness (byte order)</h4>
<p>
The endianness of the system is detected at <b>compile-time</b> (<code>#if SDL_BYTEORDER == SDL_BIG_ENDIAN...#else ... #endif</code>), not at "<b>run-time</b>" (<code> if (SDL_BYTEORDER == SDL_BIG_ENDIAN) {... } else { ... }</code>). This does not change much, since even the second form, which should evaluate to a comparison between constants, should be translated by the compiler similarly to the first one.

<h2>OSDL release management</h2>


<a name="release-before"></a>
<h3>Releasing a new OSDL version</h3>
<p>
First of all, the 
<a href="http://ceylan.sourceforge.net/Ceylan-latest/Ceylan-developerguide.html#release-before" target="_blank">Ceylan release guide</a> should be applied in the OSDL context as well. Additional actions are:
<ul>

<!--
    <li></li>
-->

    <li>copy latest Ceylan's generated <code>ceylan.m4</code> in <code>trunk/src/conf/build/m4</code>.</li>
	
</ul>

</p>

<p>
As for SVN, it leads to a tag command like:

<center>
    <table summary="Code" style="border: none">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="box">
<code><pre>
svn copy https://osdl.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/osdl/OSDL/trunk https://osdl.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/osdl/OSDL/tags/release-0.5.0 -m "First release of the 0.5 series, with SVN support, autotools-based build system, integration to the Ceylan 0.6 version, improved OSDL scheduler."
</pre></code>
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</center>

Subject: 
OSDL 0.5 released!

Body:

Hi,

we are proud to announce the 0.5.0 version of the OSDL library.

OSDL 0.5 is for the moment GNU/Linux only, and offers about the same features as the 0.4 version, but its build system has been completely revamped.

OSDL 0.5 is somewhat an intermediary version, between the 0.4 which was truely ancient (dated back to 2005 Q3), and the upcoming OSDL versions, that should add the Windows XP support and the XML management with OpenGL of tilesets for animated sprites.


Main OSDL 0.5 changes are:

	* SVN used instead of CVS
	
	* the Autotools are used, instead of custom-made GNUMakefiles
	
	* integration to the Ceylan 0.6 version
	
	* OSDL scheduler robustified and enhanced a lot 

	* numerous tests improved (full test suite added), and many bugs fixed

Feel free to download latest LOANI archive (ex:
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/osdl/LOANI-0.5.tar.bz2) to test OSDL 0.5.
       
Support available through the osdl-support@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.

Report OSDL bugs to the osdl-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.

Enjoy!

<a name="customization"></a>
<h2>Customization</h2>
<p>
To use another version of gcc than the one OSDL selected (use <code>make checktools</code> to check which would be used by default), redefine <code>GCC_ROOT</code> make variable so that it points to the compiler you want to use. Ex: if one wants to use the gcc compiler installed under <code>/usr/local</code> (i.e. <code>/usr/local/bin</code> for gcc executables and <code>/usr/local/lib</code> for its libraries), one would use: <code>make all GCC_ROOT=/usr/local</code>. If GCC_ROOT is not redefined, and if with its default value (GCC_ROOT being the directory where OSDL and Ceylan were extracted, i.e. <code>GCC_ROOT = OSDL/OSDL-x.y/src/../../..</code>) no compiler can be found, then it will be searched through the PATH. If gcc is to be found in the PATH, its corresponding libraries are supposed to be found in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

<h2>Random hints</h2>
 
<h3>Retrieving cutting-edge OSDL code</h3>
<p> One should get latest OSDL sources from SVN:

          <td>
            <div class="box">

<h5>Overall architecture of the Ceylan-OSDL pair</h5>

<p>
<center>
    <img src="OSDL-Ceylan-class-diagram.png" alt="Image"></img>
</center>
</p>

<p>
With many projects, fine tuning of installation settings is difficult since usual make variables, such as <code>INC</code> or <code>LDFLAGS</code>, are set and used directly by the project.</p>

<p>For example, often the configure step determines which series of library names and locations should be used. Too often, there is no way for the user to define his settings and to <b>add</b> directly what lacks.
</p>

<p>For example, users need to be able to add to LDFLAGS the following: <code>-L&lt;a path&gt; -l&lt;a library&gt;</code>. Unfortunately, they cannot use <code>make LDFLAGS="-L&lt;a path&gt; -l&lt;a library&gt;"</code> since LDFLAGS is used by most project, and it would erase any previous information hardcoded in LDFLAGS.</p>

<p>An unsatisfying solution would be to take LDFLAGS's hardcoded value, to add the settings the user wants to add, and to define a full new LDFLAGS value, which would contain both informations, from the command line. This solution is a bad idea, since the hardcoded value, often set by the configure step, depends on the platform, therefore the user fix would break portability.
</p>

<p>
To overcome this issue, we chose deliberatly not to use in OSDL internals the following variables:
<ul>
	<li><code>INC</code></li>
	<li><code>DFLAGS</code></li>
	<li><code>CFLAGS</code></li>
	<li><code>LDFLAGS</code></li>
	<li><code>OPT</code></li>
</ul>
  but to leave them blank (ex: <code>LDFLAGS=</code>) and
to make us of variables with the same names, but suffixed with <code>_PRIV</code>, which stands for "private to the project" (ex: <code>LDFLAGS_PRIV</code>).
</p>

<p>
That way, everywhere where library informations were needed, we used <code>$(LDFLAGS) $(LD_FLAGS_PRIV)</code>, in that order, letting the possibility to customize the build thanks to a <code>LD_FLAGS</code> which would not interfere with our <code>LD_FLAGS_PRIV</code>. So the user just has to specify <code>make LDFLAGS="-L&lt;a path&gt; -l&lt;a library&gt;"</code> to <b>add</b>, not <b>replace</b> library informations and such.</p>

<p>Of course, if ever one wanted actually to <b>replace</b> these values, he just would have to specify 
<code>make LDFLAGS_PRIV="-L&lt;a path&gt; -l&lt;a library&gt;"</code>.
</p>

<p>
This procedure applies for the Ceylan library as well.
</p>

<h3>Build messages</h3>
<p>
One should not be afraid of those libtool warnings for various libraries:
<center>
    <table summary="a box" style="border: none">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="box">
libtool: link: warning: library `&lt;your path&gt;/LOANI-installations/SDL_image-1.2.3/lib/libSDL_image.la' was moved.

            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</center>
</p>

<p>
For the moment, we did not manage to get rid of these messages, but they do not really matter since they do not denote any real problem.
</p>


<h3>Filenames</h3>

  <p>The library itself, whether downloaded as binary or rebuilt from
  sources, is named:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>libOSDL.so.0.0.5</strong>, it is the full shared
    library filename, with sonname and al, and the installation process
    should have created links <code>libOSDL.so.0</code> and
    <code>libOSDL.so</code> pointing directly towards
    <code>libOSDL.so.0.0.5</code>.</li>

    <li>similarly, there should be a <strong>libOSDL-0.5.0.a</strong>
    for the static library, along with its exact copy
    <code>libOSDL.a</code>, and with <code>libOSDL.la</code>, which
    does respect GNU libtool's conventions (no links for them, .a
    and .la are different files)</li>
  </ul><br>
  <br>

  <p>Please keep in mind that OSDL is a multimedia-oriented library
  built on top of <a href="#prereq">prerequisites</a>, so you should
  install them priorly to have OSDL-0.5 working.</p><br>
  
  
<h3>Setting up one's environment by script</h3>
<p>
One interesting file to source is <code>OSDL-environment.sh</code>, which is to be found under the prefix used by LOANI, <code>LOANI-installations</code> by default.  
</p>

<p>
By sourcing this script, you set your shell environment so that all LOANI installed tools are selected, thanks to the <code>PATH</code> and <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable.
</p>


<h3>Debugging rendering code</h3>
<p>
When developing code that performs rendering, it is often difficult to know what is exactly drawn in each step, or what might be the culprit of an unintended behaviour: the graphic system (OSDL) or the user program performing the actual rendering? One very easy way to tell it is to use the screenshot generating capabilities of the <code>Surface</code> class. For example, using <code>Surface::savePNG</code> allows to freeze graphics being generated at runtime, in order to understand what happens actually.
</p>


<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>
The build of tests is split from library's build, since we designed these tests to behave exactly as any other user application which would make use of Ceylan or OSDL.
</p>
