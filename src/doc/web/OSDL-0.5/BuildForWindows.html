<h1>How to build OSDL and its prerequesites on Windows</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>
The goal here is to explain to developers how to <b>build</b> the 0.5 version of the OSDL library for Windows, on Windows (no cross-compilation).
</p>

<p>
If a user just needs the OSDL DLL so that she can <b>run</b> an executable depending on the OSDL library (only <code>OSDL-0.5-from-LOANI-release-mt.dll</code>
 is required), then she can download, if available, a <strong>OSDL prebuilt user package</strong> from 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71354" target="_blank">OSDL File Releases</a> on Sourceforge. If an up-to-date archive is not available, please
<a href="mailto:osdl@esperide.com?subject=[OSDL-0.5]%20Windows%20User%20Build%20needed" target="_blank">ask us</a> and we will add it quickly.
</p>

<p>
If a user just want to <b>develop</b> a program or a library depending on the OSDL library (hence needing OSDL installed headers, and preferably <code>OSDL-0.5-from-LOANI-debug-mt.dll</code> and <code>OSDL-0.5-from-LOANI-debug-mt.lib</code>) and does not wish to build OSDL by herself, then she can download, if available, a <strong>OSDL prebuilt developer package</strong> from 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=158516" target="_blank">OSDL File Releases</a> on Sourceforge. If an up-to-date archive is not available, please
<a href="mailto:ceylan@esperide.com?subject=[OSDL-0.5]%20Windows%20Developer%20Build%20needed" target="_blank">ask us</a> and we will add it quickly.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If you are still reading, then it is that you really want to build the OSDL library <b>by yourself</b>. This is the recommended way. 
</p>

<p>
Here the target platform is Windows XP, be it Home or Professional edition. Note that we will not have any link with the .NET framework.
</p>


<h2>Building procedure</h2>

<h3>Toolchain</h3>
<p>
The first reading should be the <a href="http://ceylan.sourceforge.net/Ceylan-latest/BuildForWindows.html#toolchain" target="_blank">tool section</a> of the <a href="http://ceylan.sourceforge.net/Ceylan-latest/BuildForWindows.html" target="_blank">Ceylan counterpart guide</a>, which gives detailed informations about the generic conventions we use to build our developments on the Windows platform. One has to have applied the steps about the tools described in this document before going on with this one : both Ceylan and OSDL use SVN (hence depend on TortoiseSVN), are built with Visual Express, rely on Cygwin to automate the test suites, and so on.
</p>


<h3>Specific system-level prerequesites</h3>

<p>
SDL needs to have the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/sdk/" target="_blank">DirectX SDK</a> installed. Prepare to download a lot, for example the <code>february 2007 SDK</code> is 432 mb. Default path settings are fine.
</p>




<h3>OSDL and its library prerequesites</h3>

<p>
Most of the task will be to retrieve and build the various OSDL prerequesites. Luckily, we designed a light-weight command-line tool, <a href="LOANI.html" target="_blank">LOANI</a>, to automate the process.
</p>

<p>
This script is cross-platform, it can be used both on native UNIX platforms and on Windows platforms, as long as they have Cygwin installed.
</p>

<p>
On these Windows platforms, the script automates everything it can, but it still needs to be interactive, as some steps could not be performed without user specific actions (on UNIX platform the LOANI script is fully automated tough).
</p>

<p>
More precisely, the Windows user may have to perform a manual <b>SVN update</b> of Ceylan and/or OSDL repositories. This is because of a limitation of the Cygwin SVN command-line tool, that cannot handle long pathnames (low MAX_PATH constant). As long as this tool won't be fixed, the automated checkout may fail, and the user will have to complete it thanks to TortoiseSVN. The script will explain what to do, should this situation occur.
</p>

<p>
The second - and last - kind of operation requiring the user intervention is when a source package has to be built : as we are using the Visual Express IDE, one has to  <b>trigger the builds </b> from the GUI. Luckily enough, for each package, the script will automatically run the IDE with the proper arguments, so that the user will have only to right-click the solution, in the <code>Solution Explorer</code> panel, to select <code>Regenerate the solution</code>, and let the build take place before one's last action, closing the IDE and letting the LOANI script continue.
</p>

<p>
To ensure the package was correctly built, as expected, one can check that nothing failed in the Visual Express <code>output</code> window. This should be the case, apart on some rare occasions for a few Ceylan test cases : depending on the length of the path where the user chose to install OSDL and al, Visual Express tool <code>mt</code> may fall into a problem with long pathnames (again !).
</p>

<p>
Due to the use of Visual Express, the user will be prompted to trigger, for each package, the corresponding build. 
</p>

<center>
    <table summary="Code" style="border : none">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="box">
That's it ! You should have, once LOANI has finished, everything needed to make good use of the OSDL library. In case of problem, re-read everything carefully (this document, the <a href="OSDL-userguide.html" target="_blank">OSDL user guide</a>, the <a href="LOANI.html" target="_blank">LOANI guide</a>) and should the problem persist, <a href="mailto:osdl@esperide.com?subject=[OSDL-0.6]%20Windows%20Build%20Problem" target="_blank">send us a mail</a>. 
For in-depth technical details about Windows-specific inner workings of OSDL and its prerequesites, one may continue the reading. 
Most people will stop and continue by using by themselves the library.
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</center>



<h3>Some precisions &amp; hints</h3>

<p>
For all packages (OSDL and its prerequesites), LOANI has totally revamped the legacy project files (if any), so that they are up-to-date, in latest Visual Express format, and integrated alltogether : each library has its OSDL-specific precooked solution.
</p>


<p>
The full build process of all packages thus is parametrized from centralized property sheets (<code>src/conf/build/visual-express/OSDLProperties*.vsprops</code>). This file is made to be included by all project solutions. It allows to change them as a whole, once for all. This is very convenient for example when switching between debug and release modes : all libraries in the full dependency tree ought to use the same system libraries, for example <code>DLL Multithread Debug Library</code>. Do not use the <code>NODEFAULTLIB</code> switch, it only hides the problem.
</p>



<h3>Building SDL</h3>

<p>
One should look at <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.11/VisualC.html" target="_blank">this page</a> for additional explanations about SDL build.
</p>

<p><b>SDLmain.lib</b> should not be forgotten when linking to SDL's DLL. It is a trick to convert a basic main() into a suitable Winmain in the Microsoft fashion.
</p>


<h3>Building SDL_gfx</h3>
<p>
One pitfall : the code uses lrint, which is not available on Windows. The work-around has been to define a pre-processor macro lrint=floor.
</p>



 


<h2>How to add a new OSDL unit test</h2>

<p>
Adapted from its Ceylan <a href="http://ceylan.sourceforge.net/Ceylan-latest/BuildForWindows.html#unittest" target="_blank">counterpart</a>.
</p>

<p>
<ol>

<!--
	<li><b></b></li>
-->

	<li>open the OSDL <b>solution</b></li>
	
	<li><b>add</b> a new project to it</li>
	
	<li>choose project <b>type</b> : <code>Visual C++ -&gt; General -&gt; Empty Project</code>
</li>

	<li>choose project <b>name</b>, ex : <code>testOSDLBasicResourceManager</code> for source in <code>basic/testOSDLBasicResourceManager.cc</code>. Note that the initial project name is not <code>basic-testOSDLBasicResourceManager</code>, so that the associated files and directory names remain short
	</li>
	
	<li>choose project <b>location</b> in the relevant module, ex : <code>trunk/test/basic</code> for <code>testOSDLBasicResourceManager</code>
</li>

	<li>remove <b>default</b> directories : Header, Resource, Source Files</li>
	
	<li>add in project an <b>existing element</b>, ex : <code>testOSDLBasicResourceManager.cc</code>, which should lie in the parent directory of the one of this test</li>
	
	<li>go to the property manager, right click on your test project, choose <b>add an existing property sheet</b>, and select, seven directories up (in <code>src/conf/build/visual-express</code>), the <code>OSDLProperties.vsprops</code> file. Then (in that order), do the same for <code>OSDLPropertiesForTests.vsprops</code></li>
	
	<li>(optional) go to the project <b>properties,</b>, in <code>Common Properties -&gt; References</code>, click on <code>Add New Reference</code> and select <code>OSDL-0.5 library </code>
	</li>
		
	  </ul>
	</li>
	
	<li><b>rename</b> in the IDE the project, so that it is prefixed by its module. Ex : <code>testOSDLBasicResourceManager</code> becomes <code>basic-testOSDLBasicResourceManager</code>. It allows to sort the projects in the IDE panel without having the long names in the filesystem</li>
	
	<li><b>build</b> the project</li>
	
	<li>from a cygwin terminal, run playTests.sh</li>
	
	<li><b>add</b> the project file to SVN repository : for example, right-click on the <code>trunk/test/basic/testOSDLBasicResourceManager</code> directory, and select only <code>testOSDLBasicResourceManager.vcproj</code></li>
	

</ol>
