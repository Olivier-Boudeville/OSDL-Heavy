		OSDL 0.5 release notes


OSDL 0.5 has been the first OSDL version ported to Windows (XP), although this support would need an update now.

Lot of work on OpenGL, still lot to come.

OSDL and all its prerequisites should be installed by LOANI, both on GNU/Linux (stable) and on Windows (quite experimental support).

Support available through the osdl-support@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.

Report OSDL bugs to the osdl-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.
