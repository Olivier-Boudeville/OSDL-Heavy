		OSDL 0.5 release notes
		

OSDL 0.5 is the first OSDL version ported to Windows (XP). 

Lot of work on OpenGL, still lot to come.

OSDL and all its prerequisites should be installed by LOANI, both on GNU/Linux (stable) and on Windows (quite experimental support).

Support available through the osdl-support@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.

Report OSDL bugs to the osdl-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.
