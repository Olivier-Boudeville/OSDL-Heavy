		OSDL 0.5 main changes, compared to the 0.4 version



Main changes are:

	* PhysicsFS integrated

	* first support of SDL_mixer and, to a lesser extent, Agar, added

	* use of OpenGL generalized

	* enhanced scheduler (still lots of improvements coming)

	* support for some operations on the Nintendo DS added (ex: MP3 play-back on the ARM7)

	* Windows port of OSDL and LOANI

	* first works onto Orge (Erlang-based OSDL RPG Engine) added

	* license extended, went from pure LGPL to disjunctive bi-license LGPL/GPL. It allows developers using GPL software to use OSDL as well

	* integration to the Ceylan 0.7 version
