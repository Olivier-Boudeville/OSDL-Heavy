		OSDL build and installation instructions


The installation of OSDL @OSDL_FULL_VERSION@ is detailed on the website, please refer to: @OSDL_SF_URL@, notably at @OSDL_SF_VERSION_URL@ for everything specific to this @OSDL_VERSION@ version.

For automatic downloading, configuring, building and installing of OSDL and its prerequesites (Ceylan, SDL, SDL_image, etc.), read the LOANI file, on see @OSDL_SF_VERSION_URL@/LOANI.html.

Note to the UNIX users: we really recommend to rely on LOANI to retrieve OSDL. The LOANI script automates indeed the prerequesite management, which can easily become a nightmare: OSDL needs the correct tools in their correct versions, properly configured with specific options, sometimes patched, linked together appropriately, etc. Numerous pitfalls here (ex: several distributions with package management distribute obsolete or ill-configured packages), this is why we did this dull work once for all on LOANI.


If however one insists on boldly fighting its way unassisted, the installation procedure of OSDL itself is very close to the GNU standard one. 
It is mainly a matter of:
	bunzip2 -f osdl-@OSDL_VERSION@.tar.bz2 && tar -xvf osdl-@OSDL_VERSION@.tar
	cd osdl-@OSDL_VERSION@
	./configure
	make
	make check
	su
	make install
	
With future releases, one may then enter:
	make installcheck


The OSDL mailing list dedicated to bug reports is not specified here on purpose, please read the documentation first !
