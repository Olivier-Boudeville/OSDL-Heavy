		OSDL build and installation instructions


The installation of OSDL @OSDL_FULL_VERSION@ is detailed on the website, please refer to : @OSDL_SF_URL@, notably at @OSDL_SF_VERSION_URL@ for everything specific to this @OSDL_VERSION@ version.

For automatic downloading, configuring, building and installing of OSDL and its prerequesites (Ceylan, SDL, SDL_image, etc.) read the LOANI file.


The installation procedure of OSDL itself is very close to the GNU standard one. 
It is mainly a matter of :
	bunzip2 -f osdl-@OSDL_VERSION@.tar.bz2 && tar -xvf osdl-@OSDL_VERSION@.tar
	cd osdl-@OSDL_VERSION@
	./configure
	make
	make check
	su
	make install
	
With future releases, one may then enter :
	make installcheck


The OSDL mailing list dedicated to bug reports is not specified here, please read the documentation first !
