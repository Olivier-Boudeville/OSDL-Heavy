I would like to thank the full team of our game creation club, also known as the 'Club of the Floodlit Coypus', for their constant encouragements and their art of faking the belief that some day my developments will work as expected.


Specific thanks include 

	* Asmodehn Shade <asmodehn@gmail.com>, for his help regarding the dreadful porting effort
