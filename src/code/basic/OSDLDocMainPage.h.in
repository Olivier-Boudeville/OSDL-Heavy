/**

 *
 * @section intro Overview
 *
 * This is the documentation of the API corresponding to the OSDL @OSDL_VERSION@
 * version, released on @OSDL_RELEASE_DATE@.
 *
 * OSDL stands for <em>Object-oriented Simple DirectMedia Layer</em>.
 *
 * It is a free portable high-level open-source library for multimedia and game
 * programming.
 *
 * Basically, OSDL is a high-level C++ library, working on top of lower-level
 * back-ends, currently <a href="http://libsdl.org">SDL</a> and related helper
 * libraries (SDL_*), and on
 * <a href="http://ceylan.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">Ceylan</a>.
 *
 * @section use Usage
 *
 * Use OSDL.h and link your program or library with one of the following OSDL
 * libraries:
 *
 *<ul>
 *	<li>use OSDL.h: <code>CPPFLAGS +=
 * -I&lt;OSDL_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/include/OSDL</code></li>
 *	<li>use libOSDL.a, libOSDL.la or libOSDL.so variations:
 *  <code>LIBS += -L&lt;OSDL_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/lib -lOSDL</code></li>
 *</ul>
 *
 * If the user code is autotools-based, the <a href="http://osdl.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/osdl/OSDL/trunk/src/conf/build/m4/osdl.m4.in?view=markup" target="_blank">osdl.m4</a> macro, available in the <code>test</code> subdirectory, helps writing a
 * <code>configure.ac</code> file which takes into account the linking with OSDL
 * library.
 *
 * See the OSDL_PATH macro and its numerous built-in sanity checks.  One can use
 * OSDL's numerous test cases as guidelines to implement, build and run code
 * using the OSDL library.
 *
 * @section doc Documentation
 *
 * Installation is to be performed thanks to <a href="http://osdl.sourceforge.net/OSDL-@OSDL_VERSION@/LOANI.html" target="_blank">LOANI</a>.
 *
 * Refer to the <a href="http://osdl.sourceforge.net/OSDL-@OSDL_VERSION@/">OSDL version page</a> for further information about this @OSDL_VERSION@ version.
 *
 * Information about the latest OSDL release can be found <a href="http://osdl.sourceforge.net/OSDL-latest/" target="_blank">here</a>
