 * 
 * <div class="box">
 * OSDL stands for Object-oriented SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) 
 * [<a href="http://osdl.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">official site</a>, 
 * <a href="http://osdl.esperide.com" target="_blank">mirror</a>].
 *
 * Basically, OSDL is a high-level library, working on top of lowers-level
 * back-ends, currently SDL (only).
 *
 * OSDL is a state machine.
 *
 * This is OSDL version @OSDL_VERSION@.
 *
 * When multiple ways of processing exist (for example, if there is an SDL
 * fonction for drawing a line and if OSDL can do it too, its own way), 
 * you can choose to use OSDL's proper algorithms by defining OSDL_INSIDE
 * (example : <CODE>CFLAGS += -DOSDL_INSIDE</CODE>)
