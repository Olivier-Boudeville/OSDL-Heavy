 * \section intro Introduction
 * 
 * <div class="box">
 * OSDL stands for Object-oriented SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) [<a href="http://osdl.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">official site</a>, <a href="http://osdl.esperide.com" target="_blank">mirror</a>].
 *
 * Basically, OSDL is a high-level library, working on top of low-level back-ends, such as SDL.
 *
 * OSDL is a state machine.
 *
 * This is OSDL version 0.3 (pre-version).
 *
 * When multiple ways of processing exist (for example, if there is an SDL fonction for drawing a line and if OSDL can do it too, its own way), you can choose to use OSDL's proper algorithms by defining OSDL_INSIDE
 * (example : <CODE>CFLAGS += -DOSDL_INSIDE</CODE>)
